            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two great concerns of faln Man moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known, (though much neglected) to wit, <hi>Hearts Treaſure,</hi> and <hi>Hearts Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Treachery:</hi> the former of theſe, (to wit, the ineſtimable Riches of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8.) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prized or preſſed after, without ſome true and due knowledge of the latter, which is called <hi>the Plague of the Heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. and which every one ought to have a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and an experimental knowledge of; even the Plague of that fretting Leproſie, which is, (as Phyſitians do call it) <hi>Corruptio totius ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiae,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48861:13"/>
univerſally ſpread over the whole Man, that dryes up, and draws out the very Vital Blood and life of the Soul, the ſpots whereof are deeper than the skin, (like the ſpots of Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, which no Art can cure, no water can waſh off) they are not onely ſeated in the hands (and in other outward parts) but they are ſunk down into the Heart, and ingrained or ingraffed into the very ſpirit, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 2, 3. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13. 23. The ſpots are not onely in the fleſh and bones, but alſo in the very ſinews and inner parts, (where then is Mans free-will to good? <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> ſo that all the ſcraping in the world will not fetch it off, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 41, 43, 44, 45. Mans heart cannot be mended, but by making it new, and by renewing it. <hi>Moſes</hi> putting his hand into his boſome, found Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie there, and there he left it alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 6, 7. there he found it, and there he left it, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand into his boſome again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] was a golden Sentence given to Mankind, by one of the ſeven wiſe men of <hi>Greece,</hi> That every Man might know himſelf: and that this might be better done, Mans gracious Creator hath left him a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, to wit, the Holy Scriptures, wherein Man may behold his Maker, and himſelf alſo. 1. This Looking-glaſs repreſents God to Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and though that Repreſentation be but through a Glaſs darkly, 1. in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48861:13"/>
to Mans ſeeing God face to face in another World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. yet holds it out the cleareſt diſcovery of God that Man is capable of in this lower World. 2. In oppoſition to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was but a dark diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation (in ſhadows and ceremonies) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Law of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (the Goſpel) that bleſſed Looking-glaſs of the Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. Alas, poor mortal man cannot behold the face of God (otherwiſe than in his Word and Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20.) or the brightneſs of his glorious Preſence, the Majeſty whereof would ſwallow up mere Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 20, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>[Vehemens ſenſibile deſtruit ſenſum.]</hi> The object is over-violent for the faculty: Man cannot ſee the Sun <hi>[in Rotâ]</hi> in the Circle, <hi>but onely in the</hi> Beams. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw <hi>[Mercaboh velo harocheb]</hi> the Chariot in which God rode, but not the Rider in it, as the <hi>Rabbin</hi> ſaith; he ſaw his back-parts onely, but his Face and Eſſence could not be ſeen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And 2ly this Looking-glaſs of the Word of God repreſents Man to himſelf, and gives him a diſtinct and impartial character of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if rightly improved. Hiſtory makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Momus</hi> (the carping Heathen) that found fault with mans Maker, for not ſetting a Glaſs in mans Breaſt, that ſo his Heart might be ſeen: But aſſuredly God hath ſet ſuch a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48861:14"/>
Glaſs in his Word, that Man thereby may ſee his own heart, when Chriſt opens his blinde eyes to improve it: and this is a Mirrour that flatters not, a Looking-glaſs that makes a real diſcovery; not like that famous Glaſs (we read of) at <hi>Athens,</hi> which would repreſent the moſt deformed and diſcolour'd perſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very beautiful; nor like any of thoſe Artificial Glaſſes, that have (all) Impoſtures in them; as the <hi>Magnifying-Glaſs,</hi> that makes a thing look bigger than it is in quantity; or the <hi>Multiplying-Glaſs,</hi> that makes a thing more than it is in number; or as other fallacious Glaſſes, that repreſent things under our feet to ſeem above our heads, <hi>&amp; contra;</hi> things afar off to ſeem near hand, <hi>&amp; contra;</hi> yea, to ſeem of another Colour and Figure, of another Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and Scituation than indeed they are of in themſelves: In all theſe, there is <hi>[deceptio Viſus]</hi> a deceiving of the ſight: but no ſuch thing is in this divine Looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (writing to <hi>Nebridius)</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at this ſtrange Secret in plain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Looking-glaſſes, inaſmuch as the leſſer they are (according to their Module or Size) they do repreſent any thing leſſer than it is in it ſelf; yet let theſe ſame Glaſſes be made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo large, they never make the thing big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than it is indeed. Upon this obſervation that antient Father cryeth out, ſaying, <hi>[In hoc</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48861:14"/>
                  <hi>aliquid occultum latere putandum eſt]</hi> Some marvelous Myſtery lyes hid herein. Thus you ſee there are many deceitful and falſe Glaſſes, that make falſe Repreſentations; but the Looking-glaſs of the Word of God is no falſe or flattering glaſs. But as it is the Word of Truth <hi>(Dan.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17.) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd with the Spirit of Truth <hi>(Joh.</hi> 14.17.) ſo it gives no other than a true repreſentation of the complexion of your Heart, all its defects and deformities are diſcovered thereby, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 22. As the Word is a curious <hi>Critick,</hi> judging exactly, ſo 'tis a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, repreſenting impartially. Never ſay you (as ignorant ones uſually do) that you have a good heart God-ward, when this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Looking-glaſs plainly diſcovers to you, that your Heart is a very naughty Heart, <hi>evil, only evil,</hi> and <hi>continually evil,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. <hi>your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are very filthineſs,</hi> Pſal. 5. 9. and <hi>as full of falſhood as of filthineſs,</hi> Jer. 17. 9. &amp;c. <hi>Infra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There be various Repreſentations (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) both of mans Malady and mans Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in this bleſſed Looking-glaſs of the Word of God. The Looking-glaſs of the Law doth diſcover all the ſpots of fallen Mankinde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. both thoſe ſpots that are the ſpots of God's Children, to wit, Infirmities; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48861:15"/>
thoſe that be the ſpots (or rather deep ſtains, or <hi>Leopards-ſpots)</hi> of the wicked, to wit, Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5. But the Looking-glaſs of the Goſpel diſcovers the Water of the Spirit of Grace, and the Blood of the Lamb of God, wherewith thoſe ſpots are to be waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Until the Law (in the hand of a Mediator) fall upon mans ſpirit with full Conviction, Man is a jolly, jovial Creature, (with <hi>Paul) Rom.</hi> 7. 9. But when the Commandment [comes] with a piercing penetrating Power, letting blood in the heart-vein (as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.) Chriſt ſpeaking to the heart with a ſtrong hand (as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 11.) and the Spots and Freckles of a ſinful Soul are diſcovered to him, and diſcerned by him; then (and not till then) doth he repair to that Fountain that is opened (in the ſides of a bleeding and bleſſed Saviour) to waſh in, and to be cleanſed from all <hi>thoſe ſpots of Sin and of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13. 1. to be <hi>waſhed white in the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7.14. and to <hi>be cloathed with the Robe of his Righteouſneſs,</hi> Phil. 3. 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The firſt Duty as to this Looking-glaſs: Be ſure you take a view of your ſelf, and of the eſtate and complexion of your heart in this bleſſed Looking-glaſs. <hi>Motives</hi> to ſtir you up hereunto are theſe: 1. <hi>This is a Looking-glaſs of Gods own making,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48861:15"/>
excellent. All thoſe Glaſſes fore-mentioned (that give their falſe Repreſentations) are glaſſes of Mans making, and that for Curioſity and Oſtentation; but this is of Gods making, and that for Sanctity and Salvation. As 'tis ſaid of the two Tables of the Law, <hi>the Tables were the Workmanſhip of God,</hi> and the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was the Writing of God,</hi> Exod. 32. 16. ſo it may be ſaid of this bleſſed Looking-glaſs of the Goſpel, 'tis the Workmanſhip and Writing of God. 'Tis the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiome to put the Name of God to many things, to ſhew the ſuperlative excellency of thoſe things; as the Hill of God, the City of God, the Houſe of God, and the Sanctuary of God, for the moſt excellent Hill, Houſe, City, and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So this Looking-glaſs may accordingly be called, the Looking-glaſs of God, to ſet off its excellency; and its excellency calls loud upon you for the uſing of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Motive</hi> is, 'Tis a <hi>Glaſs that hath been of ſingular uſe,</hi> and in <hi>ſublime eſtimation</hi> in <hi>all fore-going Ages</hi> and <hi>Generations.</hi> The Holy Patriarchs dreſſed themſelves (both as to Faith and Manners) by this Glaſs, in their due and daily walking with God; and ſo have the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs of God dreſſed themſelves (all) by it, ever ſince God made it: Inſomuch, that all their Godly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are become as ſo many Looking-glaſſes

You muſt be a follower of them, ſo far as they were followers of God (in his Word and Will) and of Chriſt (in a Scripture-like Faith, and a Scripture-like life and converſation) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. the frailties of all thoſe Holy Saints are Recorded in the Holy Scriptures [as <hi>exempla Cavendi, non Cadendi]</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> your caution (as dangerous Rocks and Sands at Sea are marked) not for your imitation. Theſe Servants of God dreſſed themſelves up (in this Glaſs) into Scripture-hearts, and into Scripture-lives, and ſo are all ſafely landed in Manſions of glory: they are all got well home to their Fathers houſe, out of <hi>this preſent evil world</hi> (ſo called) <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. And if you do as they did, (in dreſſing your ſelf by this Glaſs) you ſhall (in time) be where they are.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The third <hi>Motive</hi> is from the <hi>three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties of this Looking-glaſs,</hi> to wit, 1. <hi>Its Truth,</hi> 2. <hi>Its Largeneſs,</hi> 3. <hi>Its Laſtingneſs.</hi> 1. 'Tis a <hi>true Looking-glaſs,</hi> and gives no falſe Repreſentations of perſons or things, as thoſe fallacious and ſophiſtical Glaſſes aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do, but diſcovers all truely and in every part, neither more or leſs than it is, neither better nor worſe than it is, neither fairer nor fouler than it is in it ſelf. 2. This is a <hi>large</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48861:16"/>
                  <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> that diſcovers the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Heart from top to toe; the hidden Man of the heart may be viewed in it, both intirely in the whole, and truely in every part. 3. 'Tis a <hi>laſting Looking-glaſs,</hi> it waxes not old, dull and crazy, as common Looking-glaſſes do; 'tis ſo Divinely ſteeled, that it will never wear off, nor contract any duſt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity: though the ſmoak of the bottomleſs pit hath endeavoured to darken the Sun and the Air of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 2. and many a falſe Gloſs hath been caſt upon this true Glaſs; yet hath it as much light and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency in it ſelf, as ever. To all which may be added a fourth excellent property of this bleſſed Glaſs, wherein it tranſcends all other Glaſſes, which diſcover onely the face and ſurface (barely) of the body or outward things, but this diſcovers the inſide as well as the outſide, and the hidden things of the heart, as well as that which is bare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The fourth <hi>Motive</hi> is, from the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul, which is far more precious than the body. The Lord Jeſus did (aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) beſt know the worth of Souls, becauſe he (onely) went to the price of Souls; and he tells you, that it is but a bad bargain, to gain the World (though 'tis impoſſible for any one to get all) and loſe the Soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48861:17"/>
the Soul of one ſingle perſon is of more worth than is the whole World; then 'tis of much more worth than the body of that perſon. It follows hence, that ſeeing you do uſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Glaſs to trim and dreſs the body, (which is the worſer part) that you may not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and uncomely to Men; how much more ſhould you uſe this ſpecial and Spiritual Looking-glaſs, for trimming and dreſſing your Soul (the better part) that you may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and unacceptable to God? This latter is of far more conſequence and importance than the former. How ought you then to look into this Looking-glaſs of the Word, due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and daily, yea as often (at leaſt) as you look into the common Looking-glaſs! 'Twas grave and godly counſel, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> gave to young Women <hi>[Veſtite vos Serico pietatis, Byſſino ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, &amp; Purpurâ pudicitiae; taliter pigmentatae, Deum ipſum habebitis Amatorem]</hi> God himſelf will become a Suitor to ſuch as do according to the Apoſtles direction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. The Prophet doth ſo diſtinctly and punctually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the Womens varniſhing vanities, as if he had (indeed) fully viewed the Ladies Wardrobe in <hi>Jeruſalem, Iſa.</hi> 3. 18, 23. and had taken a particular Inventory of them with their turrified heads and ſtretched-out necks.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Such perſons as ſpend too much time in dreſſing their Bodies by the common Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48861:17"/>
it may juſtly be feared, they ſpend too little time in trimming their Souls by this bleſſed Looking-glaſs. <hi>Bernard</hi> excellently expreſſeth this, ſaying, <hi>[Veſtium curioſitas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitatis &amp; mentium &amp; morum indicium eſt,]</hi> Over-much curioſity in outward adorning, is a ſhrewd ſign of the deformity both of Mindes and of Manners: or more plainly, exceſſive neatneſs in outward ornaments, is a palpable evidence of too much inward naſtineſs. Mark what the wiſdom of God (himſelf) ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>[Whoſe adorning let it not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let it be the hidden man of the heart.]</hi> Women are not ſimply or abſolutely forbidden there to adorn themſelves, ſo it be without Pride and Exceſs, and ſuitable to their States and Eſtates in the World: otherwiſe good <hi>Rebeccah</hi> (that immediate Daughter of <hi>Sarah)</hi> would have been blamed for wearing thoſe Bracelets and Ear-rings, which the Holy Patriarchs <hi>(Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac)</hi> ſent unto her for her adorning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 30. and Godly <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> (whoſe Heart the Lord opened) would not have been a Seller of Purple, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. If it were lawful for her to ſell it, aſſuredly it was lawful for ſome to wear it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It follows then, that what is ſpoken by the Holy Ghoſt in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. is onely ſpoken comparatively (and not ſimply or abſolutely) that they make not their outward adorning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48861:18"/>

Thoſe were (undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly) religiouſly diſpoſed women, that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled (by Troops) to faſt and pray <hi>[Pethach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ohel]</hi> at the door of the Tabernacle; and theſe inſtruments of the worlds Vanity (whereby they had formerly dreſs'd their Bodies, but which now they deſpiſed) they dedicate to God, to make the Laver of Braſs; an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby, through Faith, they might trim and ſanctifie their Souls. Oh that we had many ſuch Women in this great City, and ſuch as <hi>Eſthers</hi> Maidens, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The ſecond <hi>Duty</hi> in order to this Looking-glaſs, is, You muſt not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48861:18"/>
into the Looking-glaſs that he (himſelf) hath made for you to that very end: Yet to do ſo is not enough, unleſs (alſo) you love to do ſo. Let it be far from you to do with this Spiritual Looking-glaſs, as (Hiſtory makes mention) one <hi>Praxyllis</hi> did with her common one, which when it but truely diſcovered to her eyes her own real Deformity, ſhe quarrels with the Glaſs, and (in a rage againſt it) throws it down, and breaks it all to pieces. You may eaſily conjecture whether the true Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Glaſs, or the womans own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, were more in fault, or to be quarrell'd withal. Oh do not you quarrel with this bleſſed Looking-glaſs of the Word, which God hath moſt graciouſly given you, and hath not ſuffered it to be muffled up from you in an unknown Tongue (as in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Times) to give no true and due proſpect of your ſinful ſelf; but look into it, and love to look into it; yea look into it with a God-bleſſing Spirit, ſaying with the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>[I had not known ſin] but by the Law</hi> (that precious Looking-Glaſs) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7-9-18. As you were bred and born in ſin, and have all along lived in ſin; ſo you may dye in ſin, if you diſcern not (by looking into this divine Looking-glaſs) your Souls De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The third <hi>Duty</hi> is, You muſt not only look into it, and love to do ſo, but likewiſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48861:19"/>
to look wiſhtly and intently into it; not taking a ſleight and glancing proſpect onely, but viewing all the defects and deformities of your Heart with utmoſt intention of Soul, until there be ſome deep Impreſſion wrought kindly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by upon your Affections: This is the very ſcope of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in Chap. 1. 23-25. <hi>[He that beholds</hi> (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">

Whereby he moſt fitly noteth out thoſe weak impreſſions which the diſcoveries of the Word leaveth upon a careleſs hearer of it, who is not ſo deeply touched with thoſe Diſcoveries, as to be duely, truely, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled for them, ſo as to be brought <hi>out of ſelf unto Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. The fourth <hi>Rule</hi> is, Labour for ſuch a diſcovery of your Heart in this Looking-Glaſs of the Word, that it may have an abiding Work upon you, that the Word may be planted and engrafted in you: Until this be, the root of the Matter (or of the Word, as the word <hi>[dabar]</hi> ſignifies) cannot be in you, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 28.

A due and true ſenſe whereof, is the beſt Prayer-Book in the world. When you are ſenſible of Sickneſs, you need no Book to teach you what to ſay to your Phyſician; and when you finde your ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of your Inheritance, what to ſay to your Counſellor at Law; though you do (your ſelf) conſult Books about both thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

latter by Grace; and therefore it muſt be kept [above] all keepings, as well as [with] all keepings <hi>[Kol-miſmor netzar] Prov.</hi> 4. 23. In order and tendency unto your more diſtinct knowledge, (firſt) of your Malady, (this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Mortal, and Fatal iſſue of ſin) take theſe following Soul-awakening Conſiderations. Firſt this, That every one naturally, (high and low, rich and poor, one and other) hath an iſſue of ſin (a flux of Spiritual filthineſs) run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the Mouth, Eyes, and Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as that Woman in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 25, to 35. had) this is the epidemical evil, the univerſal diſeaſe of all faln Mankind. Secondly, This Spiritual iſſue begins betimes in every perſon, you bring it into the World with you; ſo that if it be asked you, as once Chriſt asked <hi>[How long is it ago ſince this came to him?

The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe is, <hi>[Superbos à Coelo longè propellit]</hi> he thruſteth the proud far enough off from Heaven, yea, he driveth them down to Hell, to their Father <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that King of all the Children of Pride, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> is called, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 34. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the faln, natural, unrenewed eſtate, is a proud Creature, and would (through the inſtigation of the Devil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.) be a God to himſelf, and would lick his own deadly wound whole, (as the beaſt did, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 3.) and ſo not be beholden to Chriſt for any Cure. You muſt therefore be called by Grace to come
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48861:23"/>
near to your right healer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14. and <hi>be cloathed with humility,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. as the Woman with the iſſue in the Goſpel was, who came trembling behind her Saviour, as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed both of her Diſeaſe, the effect, and of her ſin, the cauſe of her miſery; and as if ſhe would have ſtoln a Cure, which would have been but <hi>[pium latrocinium]</hi> an holy ſtealth, not wronging the owner, although relieving the taker. The filling of a Veſſel leſſens not the Fountain.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth heart-rouzing Conſideration, is that Chriſt (the Chriſtians true All-heal) hath many followers, and but few touchers: when the Multitude throng'd him, and preſs'd upon him, there was but one, to wit, this Woman with her running iſſue that touch'd him: this brings you to the remedy of the Malady, which is twofold. Firſt, you muſt get a believing touch of Chriſt; and ſecondly, you muſt keep your heart with all diligence, otherwiſe your treaſonable and treachorous heart can never be cured; your iſſues of ſin will continue running (without check and controlment) till your dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, and ſo undo you to all Eternity: the firſt of thoſe Remedies reſpects the treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of your heart more eſpecially, as the ſecond doth its treachery: firſt of the firſt of them in general; the Woman in the Goſpel had both a long and a loathſome diſeaſe, ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48861:23"/>
had <hi>laviſhed Money out of the bag,</hi> (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.6.) to purchaſe ſome cure, but had procured none; nay, ſhe had ſuffered <hi>many things of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had (well-nigh) officiouſly killed her, and had (utterly and altogether) exhauſted her, ſhe had ſpent all ſhe had upon them for their [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] doſes (which ſignifies gifts) for which ſhe had (notwithſtanding) paid dear (even her all) for them: when her own means and all other means and help fail her, ſhe repairs to Chriſt, (and not before) and there by a touch of faith, was healed for nothing: ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left her to give Chriſt for her cure. A full Chriſt and a nothing-creature correſponds beſt together.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As the Malady of this <hi>[Hemeroiſſe]</hi> or Woman with the Bloody Flux, is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and myſtically yours; ſo her Remedy muſt be yours alſo: if you do the like that ſhe did, you may have the ſame help that ſhe had: her practice muſt be your pattern: firſt, ſhe is ſenſible of her ſore ſickneſs, ſo muſt you be <hi>of the plague and filthineſs of your heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 38. ſecondly, ſhe ſeeks and ſues to the Phyſician, ſo muſt you do; <hi>the whole need not the Phyſician but the ſick, Matth.</hi> 9. 12, 13. one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible ſinners (for none are truely whole, though Juſticiaries proudly conceit themſelves to be ſo) are capable of Cure and Comfort: ſuch as ſee themſelves Chriſtleſs Creatures, cry,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48861:24"/>
                  <hi>Lord ſave me, I periſh,</hi> Matth. 8. 25. and <hi>Lord be merciful unto me, heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt thee, Pſal.</hi> 41. 4. The Phyſician hath onely the face of a Man when he comes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit you while in health; but if he do ſo when you are ſick, he hath then the face of an Angel. Oh welcome, welcome is Chriſt to a ſin-ſick Soul; till then you need not the Phyſician, and the Phyſician hath as little need of you. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe came humbly to him, even behind him, as unworthy to come before him: having a legal uncleanneſs upon her, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 25. ſo neither fit was ſhe to touch any, or to be touched by any without pollution. Thus muſt you come in all ſelf-abhorrency to Chriſt, who <hi>hath reſpect to the lowly, Pſal.</hi> 138. 6. but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the lofty, Jam.</hi> 4. 6. This made <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cry out, ſaying, <hi>Ecce magnum Miraculum, &amp;c.</hi> behold a great Miracle, God is on high, Man lifts himſelf up in pride, and God flyeth from him; Man bows himſelf down in Humility, &amp; then God deſcendeth to him: the lowly he raiſeth higher, the lofty he thruſteth lower.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And fourthly, ſhe came believingly to him, ſaying, <hi>If I may but touch, I ſhall be whole:</hi> This is a coming rightly to Chriſt, to believe you ſhall be better by him, for he proportions his performing unto your believing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.13. <hi>As you believe, ſo ſhall it be done unto you.</hi> Faith hath evermore an happy hand, and always
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48861:24"/>
ſpeeds in one kind or other; it ever hath what it would have, either in Money or in Money-worth, either in kind or in equivalency: always <hi>[ad ſalutem]</hi> according to your weal, though not always <hi>[ad voluntatem]</hi> according to your Will: <hi>He that believeth, ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. no, nor ſo much <hi>as aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 9. 33. through any diſappointment: this good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth not onely touch Chriſts Garment with her bodily hand, but himſelf alſo with an hand of Faith: and her Faith was a very glorious Faith, not much inferiour to that of the Centurion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 10. Go and do you likewiſe. When you are made ſenſible of ſin, and feel the bloody flux of natural filth iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at your eyes, mouth, hands, and other parts, run to Chriſt and touch him by Faith; then ſhall you find that Vertue comes out from him to heal your Soul; but ſtay not afar off, out of reach and touch of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Having your eyes (through Grace) in ſome meaſure opened, to behold the filthineſs and treaſon of the hidden Man of your Heart, (for what ſignifies a Looking-glaſs to thoſe that are blind?) in the Looking-glaſs of the Word; then take theſe following Encouragements, that you may come more believingly for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-touch to the Lord Jeſus. The firſt is, That Chriſt was given as a Covenant (or as the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2.) <hi>to open</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48861:25"/>
                  <hi>blind eyes, Iſa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. by the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel, Act.</hi> 26. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 4, 5, 6. <hi>&amp; Revel.</hi> 3. 18. accordingly Chriſt (in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Commiſſion from the Father) hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the blind-man, whom they brought to him and beſought to touch him, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 22. Chriſt (himſelf) became a <hi>leader of the blind,</hi> he (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) took <hi>the blind Man by the hand, v.</hi> 23. which he might have commanded to be done by ſome other, but he did it himſelf, as holding it an honour (yea a pleaſure) to do a Man (in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) any office of courteſie: and Chriſt <hi>leads him out of the Town,</hi> (as unworthy of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of being witneſs of ſo great a work of Mercy, v. 23. 26.) There he touches his blind eyes the firſt time, and made him ſee Men as Trees, v. 24. then he touches him the ſecond time, and made him ſee [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>procul &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucidè, longè latéque, all things clearly, v.</hi> 25. All which ſhews, that you may expect the ſame kindneſs from Chriſt, according to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for your Spiritual Illumination; and this he doth for you gradually, and not all at once: when you can but darkly diſcern the Plague and Leproſie of your heart, in the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs of God at the firſt, you muſt come believingly to him again, till you ſee all clearly.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſecond Encouragement, The poor and rich are alike welcome to Chriſt: for while he was going along with the Ruler, (to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48861:25"/>
heal his dying Daughter) he neglected not the poor afflicted Woman, that had not one half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny left her wherewith to help her ſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 22. 26. no doubt but <hi>Jairus</hi> (the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Synagogue) could have wiſhed the poor Woman farther off at this time, than to be within reach and touch of Chriſt, becauſe ſhe hindred his Saviour from haſting to his Daughter, that was haſting to the very point of death: but this ſweet Providence to the poor Woman, muſt come in as a Parentheſis, for the exerciſe of the Rulers Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; his Daughter muſt be dead outright; the poor Woman muſt be healed, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed thereby, ere his deſire be accompliſhed, that God may be glorified in all, and that it might be made manifeſt, that Chriſt was no reſpecter of Perſons, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34. not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, either Wealth or Wiſdom, Sex or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which outward things neither help nor hurt, neither pleaſe nor diſpleaſe him, but as they are found in a good or in a bad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: otherwiſe they are inſignificant Cyphers without a Numerical figure: <hi>Grace in Rags,</hi> is as acceptable to Chriſt, as <hi>Grace in Robes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The third Encouragement is, That which ſeparateth from the Congregation of God, and from Communion with Men, doth not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from Chriſt, but rather driveth to him, as the filthy iſſue did this poor Woman; ſhe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48861:26"/>
had a legal Uncleanneſs upon her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to be ſeparated both from touching, and from being touched by any, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.7, 11, 19, 25. neither of thoſe could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Levitical pollution: yet adventures ſhe to draw near to Chriſt, that ſhe might touch him; ſhe touches Chriſt, and had a bleſſed ſucceſs: Thus muſt you do, though your way hath been before the Lord, as the uncleanneſs of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Woman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 17. yet will he have pitty for his Holy Name, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. He will pitty you for <hi>his own Names ſake,</hi> when he cannot do ſo <hi>for your ſake;</hi> and in that very Month [of your filthineſs] find you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 23, 24. though he find you in your Blood, he will not leave you ſo, but makes that time your time of love, and biddeth you live, when (in rigour of Juſtice) he might bid you dye, even to all eternity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6, 8. Oh <hi>be of good comfort,</hi> the <hi>Maſter calleth you, Mark</hi> 10. 49. <hi>Draw nigh</hi> to him [in duty] and he will draw <hi>nigh to you</hi> [in mercy] <hi>Jam</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Sanctifie</hi> him in your Approaches, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. and he will <hi>ſatisfie</hi> you with his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 16. The Lepers (that were ſeparated from the City for their Leproſie) could ſay one to another, Why <hi>ſit we here until we dye?</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7. 3, 4. and <hi>Eſther</hi> ſaid, I will go unto the King, and <hi>if I periſh, I periſh, Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. though it was not according to the Law for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48861:26"/>
her to do ſo, yet found ſhe favour and ſweet ſucceſs, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5. 2. But ſure I am, 'tis according to the Goſpel, that you ſhould draw nigh to Chriſt, who holdeth out his Golden Scepter for you to touch it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The fourth Encouragement is, Though all other means and men fail you, yet Chriſt will not fail you: Thus the Woman had ſpent all that ſhe had upon Phyſicians, which had all failed her, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 26. and had proved <hi>Jobs</hi> miſerable comforters to her, who, inſtead of lightening her burden, had loaden'd her more; they were Phyſicians of no value, that miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her diſeaſe, had applyed Corroſives inſtead of Cordials, and through want of skill, (it may be) though there might be a good intent, they had almoſt killed her, and not cured her, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 4. &amp; 16. 2. Then, when all failed, Chriſts holy hand is reſerved for a dead lift, and faileth not: when the Pſalmiſts fleſh and heart (both) failed, yet his God never failed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. When he was ready to ſwoon away in himſelf, (having a death upon his helps, and a damp upon his hopes) then the joy of the Lord was his ſtrength, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. God was the Rock of his Heart, whence flowed his Spiritual joy, that ſame precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which no good can match, and no evil can over-match: you ſhall never find failing in him, that yet forgives your failings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.

When the Rod ſpake, he heard it, (as <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9.) who would not hear the word, v. 10. Adverſity whips many a Soul to Heaven, which otherwiſe proſperity had coached to Hell: and a <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> (in the New Teſtament) found healing mercy from Chriſt, out of whom he had <hi>caſt ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Mark</hi> 16.9. As a Woman had firſt brought in death, (to wit, <hi>Eve,)</hi> ſo this Woman muſt be the firſt witneſs of Chriſts Reſurrection: you may not then deſpair of healing Mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 15. <hi>[Omnipotenti Medicio nullus inſanabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>

               <p n="14">14. The ſixth Encouragement is, That he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will do it; he will aſſuredly heal all thoſe that come to him humbly, and touch him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly, as the woman (with the iſſue) did; for (firſt,) Chriſt never ſent any ſuch away unhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led while he was on Earth; and (ſecondly) he hath now more power and love (rather than leſs) that he is in Heaven: a glorified Chriſt (in his ſtate of exaltation) muſt needs be a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed Saviour for poor ſinners, if he were ſo ſweetly qualified to heal all that ever came to him for healing, while he was in the form of a ſervant, and in his ſtate of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This poor Woman comes trembling to Chriſt, but goes away triumphing from him: Faith in Chriſt finds a ſweeter welcome than it can expect; Chriſt turns himſelf towards touchers, as he did towards her that came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 22. May you but find a <hi>praying heart,</hi> he will (undoubtedly) find a <hi>pittying heart:</hi> put in for a ſhare of Mercy (as ſhe did with <hi>Jairus)</hi> while Chriſt is dealing Mercy.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Finally, ſeeing your heart is naturally an evil Treaſure and Fountain, and hath <hi>the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48861:28"/>
                  <hi>of death</hi> (not of life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23.) in it, as there is ſaltneſs in every drop of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bitterneſs in every branch of the Worm-wood: ſo there is ſin in every action of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed Heart,] <hi>Omnis vita infidelium peccatum eſt]</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> The whole life of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is ſin; whatſoever an unclean perſon touched, though it were holy fleſh, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 12. it was unclean: ſo every action of ſuch (his very plowing and praying) is defiled with ſin; all his works are dead works, be they (for the matter of them) never ſo praiſe-worthy, as not flowing from a principle of life within: As the fountain caſteth out its <hi>bitter waters,</hi> ſo the heart <hi>doth wickedneſs, Jer.</hi> 6. 7.

               <p n="16">16. Oh then, Chriſt muſt be the true <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> to cleanſe this <hi>Augaean</hi> ſtable of your fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy heart, by drawing that bleſſed River of Repentance through it, to waſh it clean: 'tis a touch of Chriſt that muſt ſtop your iſſue of death.

(Seventhly,) the touch of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is admirable (whereof no reaſon could ever be rendred) but the touch of Chriſt, (that makes the Heart point Heaven-ward) is more admirable.

               <p n="1">1. THe ſecond thing is, the ſecond Malady, The heart is as full of Treachery as of Treaſon, and of falſhood as of filthineſs, and therefore ſtands in need of the ſecond Remedy, to wit, of keeping with all diligence, as a falſe and deceitful Thief, (that hath given his keeper the ſlip many times) is watched and warded: firſt of the Malady, The Heart of Man is a falſe and treacherous Heart; it was no leſs than ſo in <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. (ſo ſuperlatively fallacious) and ſurely 'tis much more ſo in our day, that are caſt upon the dregs of time, and on the fag-end of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. the dregs of things are always the worſt of things, and ſo are the dregs of time; the old World was worſt a little before its deſtruction by water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5, 11, 12. (all <hi>fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their way,</hi> and all <hi>the thoughts of the heart of man</hi> [extenſively] were <hi>onely evil</hi> [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively] and <hi>continually evil</hi> [protenſively]
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48861:30"/>
there was a general Ataxy in Church and State, in Families and Perſons, (the whole frame was out of frame) ſo this new World may be worſt a little before its diſſolution by Fire, when the Son of Man comes to burn it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Iniquity ſhall abound, Matth.</hi> 24. 12. a full Sea of Sin, and a low-ebbe of Faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8. he will then find no Faith in moſt, true Faith in few, a living Faith in fewer, and a lively and ſtrong Faith in feweſt of all: in former Ages there was much heart-filthineſs and heart-falſhood, and in our following Ages there is more; oh, how are the very banks of Blaſphemy broken down in our time, and wickedneſs now more brazen-faced with a witneſs then ever! 'twas formerly night-work, as aſhamed to ſhow it ſelf in the light of the Sun, and in the ſight of Men, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 15. but now 'tis become more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and (plainly) a Noon-day Devil, Men <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their Sin as Sodome, Iſa.</hi> 3. 9. and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out in the very ſight of the Sun; not unlike that unpardonable and unparalleld Villany of inceſtuous <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. &amp; 18. 22. upon the top of the Palace, from whence <hi>David</hi> had looked, liked, and luſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Bathſhebah.</hi> Thereby God wrote his very ſin upon his puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it was in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> time, ſo it is in our time, Men are apt to ſpeak the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48861:30"/>
beſt of the worſt, and of the goodneſs of the heart under the badneſs of the life, making the heart ſtill as a City of refuge to retire to, as if it were good when all elſe be evil. The Prophet therefore opens a caſement to make a diſcovery of the falſhood and filthineſs, of the treaſon and treachery of the heart, ſaying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> Which words are a Doctrinal Poſition, or Propoſition, which conſiſts of a Subject, of a Predicate, and of a <hi>Copula,</hi> according to the Rules of Logick. 1. The Subject is the heart of Man, taken comprehenſively in Scripture, for the Mind, Soul, Conſcience, Will, and affections of Man; yea, for the whole Man, called <hi>the hidden Man of the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. for if the heart be engaged, all the whole Man is engaged. Thus Hunters adventures their necks, yea their all, in leaping over hedge and ditch, while they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their game, why? their hearts are engaged in their pleaſures; and thus it is with all, in their purſuit of either good or evil. The Heart was the beſt piece, as Created, but is the worſt piece, as corrupted: 'tis like <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s figs, as Created of God, nothing better, but as corrupted by the Devil, nothing worſe: when Man came firſt out of Gods Mint, he was a curious Silver-piece, and ſhone moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; he had then an honeſt, upright, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48861:31"/>
an innocent heart, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. he had then no droſs, no tin mingled with his Silver, no Metal better than it, but Gold, no Creature better than him but Angels; the image of God was ſtamp'd upon his his heart, and <hi>he was crowned with glory and Majeſty,</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. he had knowledge in his Underſtanding, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his Will, and order in his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But now alas, in the faln Eſtate, how is this burnt Temple to be bewailed by us, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did for theirs! <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. 12. Man, (that curious Silver-piece formerly) is now become the loſt groat, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 8. that hath loſt its ſound, its weight, its luſtre, and its ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Image: yea, inſtead of Gods Image, Satan hath drawn out his limbs upon it, ſo that Mans heart is now altogether of another make; 'tis <hi>[Inverſus Decalogus]</hi> a Diametrical oppoſition to the holy Law of God: the heart of the wicked (in the ſtate of degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>is now of little worth,</hi> like an old, crack'd, over-worn groat; though the Tongue of the juſt, (acted by a new heart in the ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation) be <hi>as choice Silver,</hi> Prov. 10. 20. Thus the Subject, to wit, the Heart of Man, (the firſt particular) neither is what it was, (at firſt) nor what it ought to be according to Gods Law: 'tis not, as it was created of God, very good (as all other things were that God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48861:31"/>
Created) but 'tis now very evil, as corrupted by Satan; <hi>yea evil it ſelf.</hi> And this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is remarked in Scripture for three things; firſt, the Matter, ſecondly, the Manner, thirdly, the Meaſure of it: firſt, the Matter (or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) that is corrupted, is the Heart, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing that both God and the Devil ſtrangely ſtriveth for; they both cry, <hi>My Son,</hi> [my Daughter] <hi>give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. The Devil once ſtrove with <hi>Michael</hi> about <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> dead body, <hi>Jude</hi> the ninth verſe: but doubtleſs it was his purpoſe to ſet up an Idol (for himſelf) in the hearts of the living <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> If Satan can but get the heart, (a ſtrong hold of it, and his ſtrong holds in it, as before) he thinks himſelf well enough: and ſo Satans eldeſt Son or Vicar; 'twas the Watchword of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, My Son, give me thy heart: be in heart a Papiſt, and go where you will, do what you will: and 'tis the heart that God moſtly wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart,</hi> &amp;c. and that God moſtly delighteth in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. as in his bed of Spices, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 2. Thus there is a wonderful kind of continual contention, (not ſo much of Earthly as of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual powers) about the conqueſt and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mans Heart: but alas! through Mans tranſgreſſion, Satan moſtly carries it, till Chriſt come to <hi>divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong,</hi> Iſa. 53.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48861:32"/>
12. Satan is the <hi>ſtrong-man armed,</hi> that (through Mans ſin) entreth into the heart (as into his Palace) thus he entred into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart: when he had concluded that curſed Contract of betraying his innocent Maſter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. [then entred Satan] who (till then) had but ſtood at the door: and when Satan hath entred and taken poſſeſſion, then he filleth it, even from corner to corner, as he did the heart of <hi>Ananias,</hi> Act. 5. 3. <hi>[Why hath Satan filled thine heart?]</hi> Alas! he fills it <hi>top-full of all unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 29. as above he fills it with Hells Houſhold-ſtuff, and quarters his Legions of unclean Spirits in this Iſle of Man, and he keeps <hi>peaceable poſſeſſion</hi> of his Palace and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>until the ſtronger man</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt) come (in the power of his Word and Spirit) with a Writ of <hi>[Ejectione firmae]</hi> to diſpoſſeſs that uſurping poſſeſſor, to conquer, plunder, and ſpoil the evil one, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21, 22. This is Chriſts reward for his ignominious death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. he ſhall divide with the Devil in his demeans. It ſhall not be all <hi>Terra-Diaboli,</hi> or the <hi>Devils-land,</hi> but there ſhall be <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuels</hi> land too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 8. whoſe Land is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with noble Vines, and his houſe (or heart) is furniſhed with graces as the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt: Chriſt ſtands at the door of the heart and knocks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20. as well as Satan, both of them woes and wins it; ſometimes Satan
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48861:32"/>
avails and wins the heart by his inſinuating temptations, and ſometimes our Saviour doth it by his exceeding great and pretious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let in by his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Having ſhown the firſt particular, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or matter, the Heart of Man, that it is corrupted by ſin and Satan; the ſecond thing to be ſpoke to, is the Praedicate, or Manner how it is corrupted: and the manner of the corruption of this matter (the heart) is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in Scripture: As (firſt) 'tis now a <hi>weak</hi> heart in the faln eſtate, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 30. ſtrong enough it is for ſin, but exceeding weak for duty: Oh, <hi>how weak is thy heart?</hi> (Secondly,) 'tis a <hi>wilful</hi> heart, that is, rebellious and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt the will of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 30. not onely the heart of <hi>Sihon</hi> (King of <hi>Heſhbon)</hi> was an obſtinate heart, but alſo the heart of Gods own <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a rebellious heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>as ſoft as</hi> wax in Satans hand (plyable enough) and yet as <hi>hard</hi> as a ſtone (altogether unplyable) in Gods hand: (3.) 'tis a <hi>ſtony</hi> heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. 26. 'tis a <hi>flinty</hi> not a <hi>fleſhy</hi> heart by nature; 'tis refractory, untractable, and impenetrable, (reſiſting the Divine touches of the Word and Spirit) the natural heart is wholly a ſtony heart, which none can draw or pull out, (as the word in the Septuagint ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) or change, but the hand of Heaven onely: the free-will of Man cannot do it, but 'tis the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48861:33"/>
free grace of God (alone) that <hi>of theſe ſtones raiſeth up Children unto Abraham,</hi> Matth. 3. 9. <hi>[Garriant illi, nos credamus]</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> Let Men prate what they pleaſe of the free-will of Man to good, there is no ſuch thing, believe it; the heart is naturally inſenſible of the Word, inflexible to the Spirit, and impenetrable to the grace of God in it ſelf; 'tis to every good work Reprobate: 'tis as hard (fourthly) as the Adamant, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 12. (which word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Untameable) that hardeſt of ſtones, <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the flint, Ezek.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>yea, than the nether mill-ſtone,</hi> Job 41. 24. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, the hardneſs of this ſtone is unſpeakable, the Hammer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not break it, neither can the fire burn it, no nor ſo much as heat it: <hi>[Hircino tamen rumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſanguine]</hi> yet if it be ſoaked in Goats-blood, 'twill then diſſolve into pieces; and ſo may the hardeſt Heart by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>(the true ſcape-goat, Levit.</hi> 16. 21, 22.) if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and improved by Faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

as rendred them incapable of Divine impreſſions; inſomuch, as neither <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> nor <hi>Miſery,</hi> nor <hi>Miracle,</hi> nor <hi>Mercy,</hi> could <hi>Mollifie,</hi> until the Lord give a new Spirit, the ſame heart in ſubſtance, but renewed in its qualities: the ſtrings (or heart-ſtrings) are the ſame, but the Tune is changed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.

               <p n="9">9. This brings in the third particular in the Logical Poſition or Propoſition; to wit, The <hi>Copula</hi> that couples together the Subject and Predicate; the word [is] the Heart [is] deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, deſperate, and deep, or dark: 'tis not ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that it hath been ſo for time paſt, or it may be ſo for time to come, but that it ever [is] ſo in all Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: As the Hearts of our fore-fathers were deceitful, deſperate, and deep Hearts, ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48861:35"/>
they are now ſuch Hearts in our preſent day, and there will be ſuch Hearts in following Ages to the end of the World. There be two great Myſteries in the World, and both are laſting Myſteries, that laſteth ſo long as the World laſteth; and they are theſe: firſt, The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt in the fleſh; and ſecondly, The Myſtery of ſin in the Spirit. The firſt is the <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16.

(Thirdly,) The quality of it, 'tis a ſacred and holy Myſtery, not like the Myſtery of iniquity: (Fourthly,) The certainty of it, [without controverſie] Myſteries may meet with contradiction, this great Myſtery much more, in all its three parts, the Doctrinal, Practical, and Providential parts of it: tell Reaſon of a Crucifyed God, of the Incarnation, and of the Reſurrection, and 'twill laugh at them, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did at the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 12. but Faith looking with better eyes than thoſe of Reaſon, (as <hi>Ahraham</hi> did) holds its hold of that which is confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controverſie.

               <p n="13">13. The Heart of Man is call'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Palace, upon a three-fold account: (1.) Becauſe of its magnificency and ſtatelineſs, ſuch as Kings Houſes uſe to be, ſo is Mans Heart, a curious piece of Gods Workmanſhip: if the whole body of Man be ſuch exquiſite Tapeſtry-work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 14. then how much more is that principal part (which both God and the Devil ſo ſtrangely ſtrives for to poſſeſs) the hidden Man of the Heart?

(2.) Becauſe of its Amplitude and ſpatiouſneſs; a Palace muſt be ſpatious, as well as ſtately; the Royal Houſes of ſome Kings are as large as little Cities, wherein perſons of all quality are entertained: Thus the Heart of Man is created with vaſt capacities, which though (as to the ſubſtance of it) it be but a little lump of fleſh, and ſo little, that (as one wittily ſaith) it would not ſerve a Kite to feed upon for one meal, yet it is ſuch a Capacious and Comprehenſive thing, that all which the Kite flyes over (in a whole day) cannot ſerve it, yea, all the World cannot ſuffice it. <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus pellaeo juveni non ſufficit orbis.] Alexander</hi> when he had Conquered one World, wept, becauſe there were no more Worlds to Conquer.

               <p n="14">14. (Thirdly,) Becauſe of its Altitude and loftineſs; a Palace is an high Building, over-topping all other Buildings; the Tower and Turrets whereof, (like that Tower of <hi>Babel, Gen.</hi> 11. 4.) reaches up to Heaven: This ('tis true) is an Hyperbolical expreſſion, wherein too much is ſaid, that enough may be believed; as in all other Hyperbolical Scriptures: but it may be truely ſaid, (even without an Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole) that the Heart of Man is a lofty thing, towering up (even) to Heaven: this was not unknown to Nature. <hi>Horace</hi> the Heathen Poet tells you, <hi>[Coelum ipſum petimus ſtultitiâ]</hi> we aſpire as high as Heaven in our a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mbitious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as <hi>Ovids</hi> proud <hi>Phaeton</hi> did to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: but 'tis better known in Scripture, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 12, 13, 14. there the Heart, (not of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> as ſome Antients think, but) of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> (rather) ſaid, <hi>I will aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, above the height of the Clouds, and above the ſtars of God:</hi> Thus alſo the Heart of the proud Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> was lifted up, <hi>to ſet his Throne upon Gods Throne,</hi> Ezek. 28. 2, 6, 10. &amp; Dan. 4. 30. &amp; 5. 20. all which were brought down from their imaginary Heaven, to the very Counterpoint of a real Hell; but let your Heart be lifted up towards God in Holineſs and

Thus you ſee the firſt thing, the Matter (which hath the Malady of Corruption in it) to wit, the Heart; now come we to the ſecond thing, to wit, the Manner how the Heart is corrupted with this Malady, that is, by Satan, (the grand Uſurper) taking and keeping poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this Palace, whereby the Temple of God becomes an Idol-Temple, a den of Thieves, an houſe full of dung-hill Deities, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>[Stercoreos deos ſuos ſuper Cor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuſtulerunt]</hi> as <hi>Piſcator</hi> reads it; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they had advanced their dirty Idols upon their very Hearts, a place where God onely ſhould (by right) be, as it is, (or at leaſt ſhould be) Gods bridal-bed; 'tis Chriſt, and not Satan, that ſhould <hi>lie all night between our breaſts, Cant.</hi> 1. 13, 16. but alas, Satan hath taken poſſeſſion, (which is eleven points of the Law) and ſet up his Throne in this Palace; whence he commands us to be ever <hi>ſerving divers luſts,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. and wherein he continually works, as the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith works in his ſhop, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. working in us, (as well as working us up to) all manner of Abominations: in as much as thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of the <hi>Malady.</hi> 2. Of the <hi>Remedy.</hi> 1.

               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Diſcovery is: In Proſperity <hi>the Soul of man is very prone to forget</hi> both <hi>his Mercies,</hi> and the <hi>God of his mercies;</hi> for, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs breeds Forgetfulneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 15. and

               <p>Mercy is many times but a nine days wonder, and 'tis hard for (even) the choiceſt Soul to keep the ſenſe of a mercy (for any conſiderable time) warm upon the heart: whereas, we ſhould keep the loving-kindneſs of God in everlaſting remembrance; but alas, it is with us, as it is with children, <hi>eaten bread is ſoon forgotten,</hi> our luxuriant and wanton minds, ſoon forget Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favours, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13. <hi>[they haſted, they forgot, Hebr.]</hi> which is a great aggravation: forgetfulneſs ſhould (indeed) be a grave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ought to bury the <hi>Injuries</hi> done to us by <hi>Man,</hi> but not any of the <hi>loving kindneſſes</hi> done to us by <hi>God, Pſal.</hi> 103. 2.</p>
               <p>The beſt uſe of a bad Memory, is to forget Injuries from man; but to forget the Benefits of God, is groſs Ingratitude: <hi>David</hi> felt ſome dulneſs and drowzineſs in this reſpect, and he therefore rowzeth up his own Soul to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring-work.

for ſome weak Brains; and therefore 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that <hi>Eliſhah</hi> muſt <hi>have a double portion</hi> (to that of <hi>Elijah)</hi> for he muſt be in favour with Kings, and great at Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things are very hard to bear with an holy frame of heart, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Diſcovery is, <hi>The Soul of man is ſoon overcharged</hi> in Proſperity, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. Chriſt (himſelf) gives this caution to his own dear Diſciples, well knowing that the ſtanding (of the beſt of fallen Mankinde) is but a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſtanding, and a very little thing will over-charge and overturn them. If this might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thoſe green trees, what can dry trees (ſuch as we are) expect? Small Veſſels cannot carry great Sails, but be in danger of over-whelming; neither is every little boat fit to launch out into the wide Ocean of worldly Felicity. There is (truely) danger to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger; and Chriſts Lambs moſtly thrive beſt upon ſhort (not over-grown) Paſtures: The intoxicating Cup of Pomp and Proſperity did hurt (even holy <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 1. 11.) and godly <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31.) when over-charged with it.</p>
               <p>Alas, what are the beſt when left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in the counſel of their own hands and hearts? good <hi>David</hi> did that bad act at that time, which he would not have done in <hi>Sauls</hi> time, and which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> (one of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes)
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48861:77"/>
would not do in his time: the beſt are too apt to furfeit of too much of the world; abundance of the things of this life, is like fiſh that is full of bones, which while Children eat too greedily, they are in danger of choaking with it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Diſcovery is, <hi>The Soul of man is more expoſed to the temptations of Satan in Proſperity than in Adverſity;</hi> 'tis ſaid that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune</hi> kills more by Calms upon Sands, than by Storms upon Rocks: And yet Sea-room here is your danger, unleſs (with bleſſed <hi>Paul)</hi> you <hi>have learnt to abound, as well as to be in want,</hi> Phil. 4. 12, 13. for then is the Soul moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and leaſt ſtands upon its watch (as at other times) yea, and is the greateſt object of Satan's malice. Oh how maliciouſly did the devil ſay to God, <hi>[Doth</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought?</hi> haſt thou not bleſt him with all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity? <hi>Job</hi> 1. 9, 10.] <hi>God delighteth in the proſperity of his ſervants,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35. 27. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſtomachs it exceedingly, and therefore ſpeaks angrily to God, that <hi>Joh</hi> might ſerve God well enough for ſuch price and pay, and that he (himſelf) could finde never a gap in the hedge (of Divine Protection) that was round about him and his; he could make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a breach, which he would gladly have done: But if you neglect your watch never ſo little in your Proſperity (as you will be very
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48861:77"/>
prone to do) then breaks in your Adverſary, and comes over the gap to ſpoil you. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> elegantly illuſtrates this truth by the Oiſter, which, while ſhe is toſſed and turmoiled by (her Enemy) the Crab in the ſalt-waters, keeps her ſhells ſo cloſe together, that ſhe ſecures her ſelf from all danger of being (then) devoured; but when ſhe lies ſecurely upon the ſhore without fear of her foe, ſhe opens her ſelf (then) to the warm Sun; which while ſhe is in doing, then cometh the Crab, and puts a ſtone between the lips of her ſhells, thruſts in her Claws, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as well as ſafely) draws out the fiſh: even ſo, the Soul, that is toſſed to and fro by the crabbed adverſary, upon the briniſh waters of affliction, <hi>ſhuts up the heart and mouth</hi> cloſe for <hi>fear of offending, Pſal.</hi> 39. 1, 2. but in the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of peace and proſperity, the heart opens, and is without a covering; then the Spiritual adverſary finds free paſſage, entrance, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth diſcovery is, <hi>the Soul of man is prone in proſperity to grow lazy in its devotion:</hi> The warmeſt Prayers are ever in the winter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 16. Summer-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are but yawning, perfunctory, and ſuperficial devotion, not powred out with connatural vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: The Kingdom of Heaven is not ſtormed.</p>
               <p>The Jews in their Ceiled houſes, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the Houſe of prayer, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1. 4.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48861:78"/>
as their beds were too <hi>ſoft,</hi> ſo their hearts were too <hi>hard</hi> for any due devotion; but Prayer is moſtly the <hi>Daughter</hi> of Calamity, as it is the <hi>Mother</hi> of Comfort. Affliction exciteth Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a pair of bellows blows up the fire: Chriſt in his Agony <hi>prayed more earneſtly, Luk.</hi> 22. 44. And <hi>Martha</hi> (with her Siſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)</hi> ſent Meſſengers to Jeſus, when their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>[Lazarus]</hi> was viſited with ſickneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 3. Thus alſo under Gods Viſitations we do moſtly viſit God, in ſending our Meſſengers of continued groans and earneſt Prayers to him, whom we much neglect in our proſperity; and therefore how juſtly may God ſay to us, as <hi>Jephthah</hi> ſaid to his Countrymen, <hi>[Do ye now come to me in your diſtreſs?]</hi> when in your proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ye ſaid to me <hi>[Depart from us] Judg.</hi> 11. 2. 7. God may ſay as much to moſt of us, who ſeldome ſeek to him, before plain need drives us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Having firſt diſcovered the <hi>Malady,</hi> the ſecond work is a word of the <hi>Remedy,</hi> in ſome following Rules and Directions, as ſpecial helps againſt the hearts treachery, in a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: 1. Direction is, <hi>in proſperity you muſt</hi> (with holy <hi>Job) greatly fear adverſity,</hi> Job. 3. 25. for God (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> hath <hi>ſet the one over againſt the other,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 14. he hath ſet them (as it were) in <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> in an equal balance; the one is up at one time, and the other at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48861:78"/>
time: there is a viciſſitude of all created beings; there is foul weather, as well as fair; night as well as day; and Winter as well as Summer: You muſt <hi>expect Sickneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>enjoy Health,</hi> and Adverſity as well as Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: You may not ſay with <hi>David, [My mountain is ſo ſtrong I ſhall never be moved,]</hi> Pſal. 30. 6. for even the ſtrongeſt mountains melt at Gods preſence, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. 3, 4, 6, 7. either when God ſhews you the <hi>preſence</hi> of his <hi>anger,</hi> or only hides from you the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of his <hi>favour:</hi> God goes (as it were) in a circle with <hi>David</hi> in that 30th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the various Providences that he was (at ſeveral times) under, made (as it were) a piece of checkered work, the <hi>black</hi> of Miſery, as well as the <hi>white</hi> of Mercy. There is no man, no thing, that can ſay <hi>[I am]</hi> but God, whoſe Name it is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14. and who only is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 8. If God finde that Proſperity makes us too <hi>light</hi> and frothy in his ballance, then <hi>(as there is need)</hi> he makes us <hi>heavy</hi> with Affliction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſecond Direction is, <hi>Be ſure that in your Proſperity you forget not divine Threatnings, as you are apt in your Adverſity to forget divine Promiſes.</hi> As the higher that the River riſeth, the higher doth riſe the Boat that ſwims in it: So the Minde of man (as the Boat) is apt to be lifted up with an high and proſperous eſtate,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48861:79"/>
as <hi>Obad.</hi> 3. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. (whereas in Proſperity you ſhould ever have your Minde <hi>below</hi> your Means, and in Adverſity <hi>above</hi> them.) Now there is no better way to keep down the Minde below the Means, than by making a beleeving Uſe of Divine Threatnings, which ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to paſs: It cannot be otherwiſe but <hi>your heart will be lifted up above your brethren</hi> (as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 20.) in proſperity, unleſs you be preſerved from it by beleeving that God is as certain in <hi>accompliſhing his Threatnings,</hi> as he is in <hi>fulfilling his Promiſes:</hi> If you take the Jewels of his Mercies, and make Idols of them (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 2, 3, 4.) or if you abuſe any of his Corn or his Wine, or any of his Flax or his Wool, (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 8, 9.) you muſt know, that God will not take it well at your hands; no, he hath threatned <hi>there</hi> to take them from you; you ſhall no longer be truſted (as a Steward) with them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The third Direction or help is, <hi>Look upon Proſperity as harder to bear with an holy frame of heart, than is Adverſity: But when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw there was reſpite, he hardened his heart,</hi> Exo. 8.15. If you be Proſperity-proof (as the Walls of ſome Caſtles are ſaid to be Cannon-proof, and the Armour of ſome Captains is ſaid to be Muſquet-proof) then you need not fear Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: If Adverſity hath (in all) killed its Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48861:79"/>
ſure I am, Proſperity hath killed its ten Thouſands: <hi>[Nulla Infoelicitas frangit, quem nulla Foelicitas corrumpit]</hi> No Adverſity can break him, whom no Proſperity can corrupt: <hi>Through peace</hi> (and proſperity) Satan <hi>deſtroyeth many,</hi> Dan. 8. 25. as the <hi>Grecians</hi> did <hi>Troy</hi> with their peaceable pretences of entertaining the <hi>Trojan</hi> horſe: The ſame Manna melted by the heat of the Sun, which otherwiſe would endure to be baked in an Oven-fire: Take heed that the warm Sun-ſhine of proſperity melt not away your very <hi>ſeeming to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Jam. 1. 26. and you become only as <hi>the Morning-dew,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 4. when the hot-fire of perſecution does not ſhrink you in: <hi>Luther</hi> uſes this Proverb, <hi>[Bonos ferre dies, oſſa requirit valde robuſta;]</hi> the ſence whereof is, It requires more ſtrength to carry well under good, than under evil days: Travellers caſt ſtones at laden, not at fruitleſs trees. So doth Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 1.2.7.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The fourth Help or direction is, <hi>In Proſperity be joyful,</hi> to wit, in God and Godlineſs, Eccleſ. 7. 14. [beiom tobah heieh betob,] <hi>In a good day be you in good,</hi> Hebr. which implies, You muſt (1) be in a good frame: (2) Take a good courſe: And (3) be of good cheer, or be joyful, <hi>Delighting your ſelf in Gods great goodneſs to you,</hi> Neh. 9. 25. You muſt look beyond Mercies, at the God of your Mercies, and be both thankful to him, and joyful in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48861:80"/>
him; <hi>Let him that rejoyceth, rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 31. Jer. 9. 23. Pſal. 33.1. Phil. 3.1. and 4. 4. Zech. 10. 7. Iſal. 41. 16. If you be in ſuch a good frame, and (breaking off ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes) you take a good courſe (to wit, to be fruitful, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31.) this may <hi>lengthen out your tranquillity,</hi> Dan. 4. 27. If you ſerve your God <hi>in the abundance of all things,</hi> Deut. 28.47. The more Wages God gives you, the more Work he expects from you: For <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar was four times as big as that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple was ten times as big as that of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s; to teach you, that where God gives much, he alſo expects much. The better man you are in your Temporal eſtate, the better man you ſhould be in your Spiritual too. If you fail herein, God may <hi>Curſe your bleſſings,</hi> Malac. 2. 2. and blaſt your hopes, making you <hi>aſhamed of your revenues, through his fierce anger,</hi> Jerem. 12. 13. cauſing you to know the <hi>worth</hi> of Mercy, by the <hi>want</hi> of it; yea and <hi>deſtroying you, after he hath done you good,</hi> Joſh. 24. 20.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The fifth Help and Direction is, <hi>Put your whole truſt in God,</hi> (and not any part of your <hi>truſt in uncertain Riches,</hi> Mark 10. 24.) <hi>in the day of your Proſperity;</hi> this is harder to do, than in the day of Adverſity: For moſt rich men think themſelves ſimply the ſafer and the better by their Riches, and ſo make <hi>their</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48861:80"/>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> (as it were) <hi>their God,</hi> and have a kinde of Confidence and Hope in them, <hi>Job</hi> 31.24, 25. While the <hi>Mammoniſt</hi> ſaith to his Gold, <hi>[Thou art my confidence]</hi> he (as it were) bows the knee (at leaſt of his heart) and worſhips before his golden god, ſaying to it, <hi>If thou fail me, I muſt needs periſh;</hi> this the Apoſtle expounds, calling it a <hi>truſting in uncertain Riches,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17. which is (plainly) a Creature-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and no better than flat Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. and ſpiritual Adultery, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, in a ſence both active and paſſive; for it maketh a man (or this <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſt)</hi> in his own perſon actually to hate God, and (reciprocally) to be hated by God, for ſo doing: Now, who would buy Gold at ſo dear a rate? Upon this account 'tis harder to truſt God in proſperity, than in Adverſity; for in the former the creature interpoſeth betwixt God and you, and therein you are apt to ſtay and ſtick faſt, and to go no further; whereby your truſt in God is eclipſed, as the Moon is by the Interpoſition of the ſhadow of the Earth, and the Sun is by the Interpoſition of the body of the Moon 'twixt us and him: in the firſt, God's goodneſs (only) draws you; but in the ſecond your own Neceſſity drives you to God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The ſixth and laſt Direction is, <hi>Look upon all your Plenty and Proſperity</hi> (that you do
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48861:81"/>
enjoy) <hi>with no other than a Pilgrims eye, and uſe all with no other than with a Pilgrims heart:</hi> This <hi>David</hi> did, acknowledging himſelf but a Stranger and a Sojourner (even in the beſt and moſt flouriſhing eſtate that ever he was in) 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. looking through all his Riches and Honours, at God the giver of them, ver. 12. <hi>Who giveth all things richly to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6, 7. and therefore hath a Right and Soveraignty to <hi>take</hi> from you (at pleaſure,) as well as to <hi>give</hi> to you, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. You muſt (both) uſe and looſe all with a God-bleſſing heart, knowing that Pilgrims are ſubject to many miſeries and moleſtations, both Satanical and ſecular; and that the property (of all) is God's, even while the poſſeſſion is yours. This the Patriarchs acknowledged, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 9. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 13. and the Apoſtles, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 14. and Prophets, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 12.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48861:81"/>
for man bears miſery in his very name: There be four <hi>Hebrew</hi> names for Man uſually men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the holy Scriptures, and theſe are <hi>[Iſh, Enoſh, Gheber,</hi> and <hi>Adam;]</hi> and of theſe four, there be three of them that do carry Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in their very ſence and ſignification: So that 'tis three to one againſt every man, but he ſhall have his <hi>Adverſity,</hi> or (as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) ſomething to be againſt him in one kinde or another, if yet he ſay not with old <hi>Jacob, [All theſe things are againſt me,]</hi> Gen. 42. 36. The firſt name of Man in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>[Iſh,]</hi> ſo named <hi>[à ſonitu]</hi> from ſound or noiſe: for Man comes into the world <hi>crying,</hi> and goes out of the world <hi>groaning;</hi> and all the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe two extremes, or <hi>[Termini à quo &amp; ad quem]</hi> the firſt term of <hi>birth,</hi> and the laſt term of <hi>death,</hi> Man is no more than <hi>a ſound or noiſe,</hi> while he is acting his part upon the ſtage of the world (whether it be a publick or private part) all that time of his appearing upon that ſtage, he (indeed) may make ſome noiſe (leſs or more, in his place or ſtation; but when the time of his diſappearing cometh (to wit, <hi>the day of his dying,</hi> as 1 Sam. 26. 10.) then all his noiſe is at an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond name in <hi>Hebrew</hi> for Man is <hi>[Enoſh,]</hi> which hath two ſignifications; firſt it ſignifies <hi>Miſery,</hi> or Calamity, as if Man (in the fallen eſtate) were made up of nothing elſe, but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48861:82"/>
                  <hi>of Sin and Miſery:</hi> Secondly, it ſignifies (as ſome render it) <hi>Oblivion,</hi> as if Man (becauſe of his miſery) were ſcarce worthy to be <hi>taken notice of, or remembred, Deut.</hi> 25.19. and 32.26. <hi>Job</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 16. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Hebrew</hi> name for Man is <hi>[Gheber]</hi> Lamen. 3. 1. <hi>I am the</hi> [Gheber] or <hi>man, that hath ſeen affliction;</hi> though the word (indeed) doth ſignifie [great, or a great man] yet not ſo great, as to be beyond or above the touch (yea the churliſh touch) of trouble: No man was ever (yet) found in the world, either ſo good or ſo great, as to be raiſed (either by his <hi>goodneſs</hi> or <hi>greatneſs)</hi> above the reach of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Hebrew</hi> name for Man is <hi>[Adam]</hi> which ſignifies [earthly;] which plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that ſuppoſe a Man (a ſon of <hi>Adam)</hi> do grow great in the world, yet cannot he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in that greatneſs, becauſe he is earth, <hi>He is of the earth, earthly,</hi> Joh. 3. 31. and <hi>he is of the earth, earthy,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 47. <hi>Duſt he is, and unto duſt he muſt return,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 12. 7.

               <p n="3">3. The Deceitfulneſs of the Heart in this ſtate of Adverſity, is diſcovered in the many branches thereof; as firſt, 'tis diſcovered <hi>by mans dulneſs to underſtand the minde of God in his Afflictions,</hi> or the ſpring and original of them from whence they come, whether from chance, or from God: God commands man <hi>[to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it,]</hi> Micah 6. 8. But alas, man is exceeding dull and deaf to hear the voice of the rod, or the voice of God in the rod: God ſpeaks <hi>[once and twice, and man perceives it not,]</hi> Job 33. 14. Herein <hi>Job</hi> (himſelf) was puzzled and at a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,</hi> when he cryed to God, <hi>[Shew me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou contendeſt with me,]</hi> Job 10. 2. Thoſe reflect acts of the inner man, come hardly off with the heart of man; <hi>blind and dumb croſſes</hi> (ſuch as we know not what they point at, and ſpeak to us, nor from whence they come) <hi>are never good:</hi> as in aſcribing them to chance, as if things were of themſelves, and fall out well or ill of themſelves, and the hand of the great God were in none of them. The Pagan <hi>Philiſtims</hi> conſult with their Diviners
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48861:83"/>
about the cauſes of their Afflictions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>(When the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them,</hi> 1 Sam. 5. 6. 9.) not knowing whether to aſcribe them to Chance, or to divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. If you at any time harp upon this ſtring of Hap and Chance, (in the mean while, if not denying, yet (at leaſt) doubting of Gods all-ordering Providence) your heart doth deceive you. The Rabbins ſay, when <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s hand was withered up, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.4. that his lying Prophets told the King, It was but a chance that had hapned to him; and thereby they withheld him from thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, who had ſmitten him; and from reflecting upon himſelf and his ſin, which was the procuring cauſe of that Judgment of God.

That which is to us but caſual and contingent, is yet by God Almighty both fore-appointed and effected: That which is <hi>Caſualty</hi> to man, is no other than <hi>Counſel</hi> to God; and what is Chance to the ignorant man, is no leſs than <hi>[the Lord]</hi> to religious <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 1. 21. <hi>[The Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and taketh.]</hi> All Chances and Changes are as much in God's hand, as is Time it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 15.

We do not finde that the very <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> (in the place before-quoted) while they dreamed of a Chance, did worſhip this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as a Goddeſs.

               <p n="13">13.

               <p n="14">14. The fourth helpful Conſideration is, What is the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>occaſion</hi> of your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This was it that puzzell'd <hi>Job,</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. You muſt labour to ſpell out Gods minde in every trouble, that (by his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48861:90"/>
Providence) befals you, and <hi>hear the voice of his rod,</hi> Micah 6. 9. never being ſatisfied with dumb croſſes; <hi>they</hi> have always <hi>a voice,</hi> if <hi>you</hi> have but <hi>an ear;</hi> they are not <hi>dumb,</hi> if you be not <hi>deaf.</hi> God many times points out to Man his very ſin by the rod, and writes his <hi>ſin</hi> upon his very <hi>puniſhment; Judg.</hi> 1. 7. that Lord of <hi>Bezek</hi> had learnt ſo much ingenuity, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods art of Juſticing in a moſt exact way of Retaliation; his puniſhment did (to an hair) correſpond with his ſin. The Apoſtle tells you, that <hi>unworthy communicating</hi> was the ſin, which was the procuring cauſe of the great Mortality at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30. for God will <hi>be ſanctified of all that draw nigh to him,</hi> Levit. 10. 3. Sin is ever the occaſion of Sickneſs and Suffering, when poſſibly it may not be the immediate and particular cauſe; and Sin is the cauſe in general, when this or that particular ſin is but the occaſion. <hi>Job</hi>'s Affliction was not for a puniſhment of this or that particular ſin, but for the trial of his Grace, and to evidence unto Satan, that he was no Hypocrite; yet did he acknowledge to God, <hi>[I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver nf men?]</hi> Job 7. 20. He puts himſelf into the hands of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in hope of his <hi>Mercy:</hi> he confeſſes his Malady (to wit, his <hi>ſinning,</hi> to be the juſt occaſion of his <hi>ſuffering)</hi> and ardently enquires after a due
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48861:91"/>
Remedy: yet this good man deſired further to know (not ſo much to ſatisfie his Curioſity, as his Conſcience) why he was ſo afflicted, whether for ſin or for trial; and if for ſin, he begg'd of God to <hi>Make him know his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and his ſin,</hi> Job 13. 23. to wit, that particular ſin which thou chiefly ſtrikes at.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Afflictions have a voice, (as above) and ſay to the afflicted, as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, [<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, and ſearch, Iſrael hath ſinned.]</hi> Joſh. 7. 10, 11. And as the Mariners ſaid to <hi>Jonah, [What evil haſt thou committed, what good haſt thou omitted?]</hi> Jon. 1.8. Something ſurely is <hi>amiſs,</hi> that God would have <hi>amended.</hi> It is therefore meet to be ſaid unto God (and that with a <hi>Surely) [I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more,]</hi> and though yet I be in the dark, and know not the right and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſe wherefore I am afflicted, <hi>[That which I know not, teach thou me,]</hi> Job 34.31, 32. Alas, men are very apt to miſtake themſelves herein, and (like the Child <hi>Samuel)</hi> when God calls one way, to run another way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Yea the Devil alſo deals with the afflicted, juſt as the wretched Jews did with Chriſt, when they did blind-fold him, and bid him prophecy who ſmote him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 64. Thus Satan holds his black hand before the eyes of mens Underſtanding, and then bids them prophecy who ſmote them,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48861:91"/>
and for what. Hence it is, that in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions we many times grope like blinde men, only gueſſing at this cauſe, and at that, but ſeldome hitting upon the right; and therefore God muſt be ſought unto for direction herein, and beſought alſo graciouſly to point out the ſin he ſtrikes at: This <hi>Job</hi> had done once, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. and again, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 23, but <hi>Elihu</hi> would have him to do it yet better, as he tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd him, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31, 32.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider theſe few following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. (1.) When you have thus ſought and beſought the Lord for Inſtruction herein, Obſerve <hi>at what door doth your Conſcience</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by the Word) <hi>lay your Affliction;</hi> for God keeps his Petty-Seſſions in the Court of Conſcience, and therein you may hear his Voice. (2.) <hi>Labour to have as deep a ſenſe of Spiritual Evil,</hi> as of Temporal: A blind eye may bring you to Chriſt for Cure and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when a blind Soul will not do ſo. (3.) In your Adverſity <hi>forget not Divine Promiſes,</hi> as in your Proſperity you may not be mindful of Divine Threatnings. (4.) <hi>Let your minde be above your means</hi> in Adverſity, as it ought to be below them in Proſperity. (5.) <hi>Let not your cuſtome of being delivered</hi> from this or that particular Danger, encourage you more than Gods promiſe of Deliverance from all evil. (6.) <hi>Be not more prone to ſpeak of your Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48861:92"/>
                  <hi>than of your Mercies;</hi> of your Loſſes, than of your Gains (as moſt men commonly do;) for if ſo, it plainly ſhews, you would rather have your ſelf pitied for the former, than your God praiſed for the latter. (7.) <hi>'Twill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Sufferings,</hi> to take notice how many do ſuffer more pains for eternal Pains, and for Damnation, than you have yet done for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and for Salvation. (8.) It may likewiſe comfort you to know, that <hi>Chriſt by his Croſs</hi> hath taken away the <hi>Curſe of your Croſs,</hi> though not the croſs it ſelf; which if he had done, then, as the Croſs (indeed) would have done you no hurt, ſo neither could it have done you any good; whereas how many Saints have bleſt the Lord for their ſanctified Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they would not have been without them for a world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71.75. (9.) Know, that Miſery, ('tis true) may be your <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet (if you be truely godly) it ſhall never be your <hi>portion;</hi> 'tis Mercy (not Miſery) that is the portion of all the Veſſels of Mercy. (10.) Know alſo, that your God (who chaſtens you) will ſoon ſay, <hi>[It is enough,</hi> &amp;c.] 2 Sam. 24. 15, 16. 'Tis an excellent Note that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus</hi> makes upon this place, underſtanding [by the appointed time] the evening of the firſt day, which (if ſo underſtood) doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily commend the Mercy and Gentleneſs of God, who, for three days of Peſtilence threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

No, he quickly repents him of the evil, and <hi>leaves a bleſſing behinde him,</hi> Joel 2. 14. (Laſtly,) Let God vindicate his own Holineſs, who, though he <hi>pardon</hi> ſin, yet will not <hi>patronize</hi> it, no not in his own Children, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30. 32, 33. yet <hi>Paul</hi> may be happier in his chains of <hi>Iron,</hi> than King <hi>Agrippa</hi> was in his chains of <hi>Gold:</hi> Oh that a <hi>bitter</hi> life may make you look for a <hi>better</hi> life!</p>

All theſe (Men and Women) well knew, that they were not the very perſons which they ſeemed to be.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But now the firſt and great Queſtion to be anſwered is, Whether in this <hi>Hiſtrionical Hypocriſie</hi> (which is the greateſt cheat in the world) a man may be an Hypocrite, and not know himſelf to be ſo? Anſwer firſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48861:96"/>
This Hypocriſie is the grandeſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Cheat of the cheating heart of fallen Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as it is 1. A Cheat endeavoured to be put <hi>upon God himſelf.</hi> 2. A Cheat accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed upon <hi>a mans precious and immortal Soul.</hi> 3. A Cheat for <hi>Eternity.</hi> 4. A Cheat in things of <hi>greateſt importance,</hi> and not in trifles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore you have need <hi>to keep your heart with all diligence,</hi> that you be not cheated thereby in this worſt kinde of Cheatery. Secondly, I anſwer in particular. 1. <hi>Zanchy</hi> (who is called a Magazine of all Divine Literature) makes two forts of Hypocrites. 1. Such as <hi>know not themſelves to be Hypocrites,</hi> but think-themſelves ſound, and good enough; and he inſtanceth it in that proud Phariſee, that thought himſelf as good as the beſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. as I have already ſhown you in the foregoing pages. His ſecond inſtance is in <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, who thought he did God <hi>very good ſervice</hi> in <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Church,</hi>

               <p n="8">8. There be others alſo, that bring a (third) Inſtance, to wit, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> whom not only <hi>Philip</hi> took for a Beleever (and baptized him) but he might take himſelf for one in his Hiſtorical Faith, while he continued with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> Acts 8. 13. And when the holy <hi>Simon (Peter)</hi> had detected this wicked <hi>Simon (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus)</hi> of Hypocriſie, yet was he not ſo wicked, but he begs the prayers not only of <hi>Peter,</hi> but of the other Apoſtles, unto God for him, and that for the pardon of his ſin, that he might not be miraculouſly ſlain (as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> had been, Acts 5. 5. 10.) <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me,</hi> Acts 8. 24. The ſecond fort are ſuch as know themſelves to be Hypocrites, and their hearts are privy that they do but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all that they either ſay or do in the ſervice of God; thoſe be Hypocrites indeed, that know well (all along) themſelves <hi>not to be</hi> what they <hi>ſeem to be,</hi> and not to be <hi>unto God,</hi> what they ſeem to be <hi>unto men.</hi> As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt ſort of theſe, whether they may (properly, and by a genuine Idiome of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48861:97"/>
Speech) be called Hypocrites, ſome Learned do doubt, ſaying, <hi>A man cannot well be an Hypocrite, and not know it;</hi> and their reaſon is this, becauſe the true and proper notion of Hypocriſie is, to <hi>pretend</hi> one thing, and to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> another; or to <hi>intend</hi> one thing, and <hi>act</hi> another.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſecond particular Anſwer is this, That (notwithſtanding what is ſaid above in the firſt Anſwer) I cannot but affirm, (in a ſound ſence) <hi>A man may be an Hypocrite, and not know himſelf to be one,</hi> upon theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grounds and Reaſons. The firſt Reaſon is, As <hi>Sincerity</hi> may be in a man, and yet the man may not know it, (the moſt ſincere Saints are ever moſt ſuſpicious of their own Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;) even ſo (according to the Rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries) <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> may be in the Soul, and yet the Soul may not know it. That the former is true, is manifeſt; inaſmuch as the <hi>ſoundeſt</hi> hearts are evermore the moſt <hi>ſelf-ſuſpecting</hi> hearts: No ſooner had Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>[One of you ſhall betray me;]</hi> but immediately all the true-hearted of them were filled with holy jealouſie, and each of them ſuſpecting himſelf, ſaid, <hi>[Maſter, is it I?]</hi> whereas the falſe-hearted <hi>Judas</hi> came lagging (all behinde) in this ſelf-ſuſpecting work: None are more filled with Jealouſies (about the ſoundneſs and unſoundneſs of their hearts)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48861:97"/>
than the ſoundeſt and ſincereſt Souls; but the Hypocrite is that fool of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, that <hi>truſts</hi> in the truth of his own treacherous <hi>heart,</hi> Prov. 22. 26.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſecond Reaſon is, There is a <hi>natural</hi> Sincerity, and Plain-heartedneſs, (that ariſes from ſome mens <hi>natural</hi> Conſtitution) which may beguile the Soul, and make them think they are <hi>Evangelically</hi> ſincere, when they are (in Gods account) no better than Hypocrites: You may obſerve ſome natural men ſo candid and ingenuous in their common dealings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man, that they would not (for a world) deceive their Neighbour in any thing: This was the Sincerity of the Heathen King <hi>(Abimelech,) Gen.</hi> 20. 5, 6. who had not any purpoſe to wrong <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to enjoy <hi>Sarah</hi> any otherwiſe than as his Wife; what he did otherwiſe, was done out of Ignorance. This was indeed a good <hi>Second-Table</hi> Sincerity. This deceives many a Soul, although they (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together) be ſtrangers to the <hi>Firſt-table</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity: a Sincerity as to man, may be in man, without a Sincerity as to God: This is (it muſt be acknowledged) <hi>a good Nature;</hi> but alas, 'tis no better than <hi>a bad Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The third Reaſon is, There is likewiſe <hi>a Moral</hi> Sincerity (as well as <hi>Natural,)</hi> to wit, a good Nature, and a ſweet natural Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition notably improved, ſuch as was in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>

and <hi>Seneca</hi> (thoſe two great Luminaries in the Heathen world) eminently improved by a ſtrict Education in the Liberal Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: How much more may ſuch a ſweet candid Diſpoſition from Nature be higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, by a ſtrict Education under the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (than could be attained unto by any heathen Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy) ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> had (while a Phariſee) <hi>at the feet of</hi> Gamaliel, Acts 22. 3. and 26. 5. Moral Vertues, which are not <hi>infuſed</hi> (as The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Graces be) but are <hi>acquired</hi> by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and highly improved by a ſtrict <hi>Education,</hi> may deceive many Souls; and ſuch may conceive themſelves ſound perſons, and in a ſafe Spiritual ſtate and condition, yet ſtand upon <hi>a ſandy foundation,</hi> and not upon <hi>the ſure rock</hi> (that Rock of Ages, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 4.) Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And hence <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls the beſt products of this Moral Vertue, <hi>[ſplendida peccata]</hi> but ſhining ſins. You ſee ſome things ſhine in the night, and yet that ſhining doth but proceed from Rottenneſs. <hi>[Sordet in ore Judicis, quod fulget in conſpectu Judicantis,]</hi> that which is <hi>highly eſteemed amongſt men,</hi> is no <hi>better than</hi> [ſhining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The fourth Reaſon is, This ſweet natural Diſpoſition may yet be moſt highly improved under the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (more than under the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes)</hi> which hath nobler <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements,</hi> and better <hi>Promiſes, Hebr.</hi> 7. 19. 22. and 8. 6. and 9. 23. the Goſpel hath a better <hi>Hope,</hi> better <hi>Promiſes,</hi> a better <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and is a better <hi>Teſtament,</hi> a better <hi>Covenant</hi> than the Law: This Goſpel-Adminiſtration may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bring ſome men to high Illuminations, to delightful taſtes of Spiritual things, yea and to ſome inferiour Gifts and Operations of the Spirit alſo, as thoſe in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5. all which may ſatisfie the ſouls of men, and make them think themſelves ſound and ſincere Saints and Servants of God, yet no better than Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in God's eye: Alas, there is <hi>ſeeming</hi> Grace, as well as <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace: There is no true Grace wrought by God, but Satan may have his counterfeit to it; he is God's Ape, and hath oftentimes imitated God. If God's Servants work Miracles in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Satans <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers can do ſo with their enchantments:</hi> As there is a falſe Faith, and a falſe Hope, as well as a true and lively one, (every true Grace hath

And I the rather take this Method, becauſe as in natural Diſtempers, when the Cauſe thereof is found out by their proper Symptomes and Indications, then is the Cure accounted to be half done: even ſo it is in Spiritual Diſeaſes. The firſt falſe ground of thoſe Self-deceivings may be, <hi>an outward Peace, and plenty of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goods:</hi> How many do bleſs themſelves herein, as if they were high in God's favour, becauſe they do enjoy thoſe low and common

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48861:100"/>
Diſpoſition, yet 'tis but ſtill a corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature: The firſt man defiled Nature (by his Fall,) and ever ſince Nature hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Man, yea every Man, not only thoſe that are moroſe, and of a croſs-grain'd and crooked Temper naturally; but even thoſe alſo that have the moſt compos'd, calm, and candid conſtitution of ſpirit from their birth only. The faithful Creator did ſow good Seed in his own Soil, but the Envious one (that <hi>Superſeminator,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) <hi>came by night and ſowed his tares,</hi> Mat. 13. 24, 25. This malicious Enemy (the Devil) would not ſtay to pour in his poiſon into every veſſel of the heart of Man, as every man is born and comes into the world; but he takes a craftier courſe in pouring his poiſon into the very root and fountain of Mankinde, to wit, into the firſt man <hi>(Adam)</hi> that ſo all the branches and ſtreams (ariſing thence) might be poiſoned alſo: <hi>God made man</hi> (at firſt) <hi>upright, but man</hi> (through the Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations) <hi>hath found out many</hi> (ſinful) <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29.

                  <hi>whole evil is in man,</hi> and <hi>whole man in evil,</hi> and he is turned upſide down (by his Fall) into an univerſal oppoſition to the Law of God: hence the beſt nature in the world is no better than <hi>a wild Olive,</hi> Rom. 11. 24. and doth retain, yea maintain (and that very ſtrongly) thoſe two ſtrong holds of Satan in it, to wit, (1.) <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt God and all goodneſs; and (2.) <hi>

               <p n="4">4. The third falſe ground may be, your miſtaking <hi>Civility</hi> for <hi>Sanctity,</hi> or <hi>Morality</hi> for true <hi>Piety:</hi> There be ſome in our day that do cry up <hi>Morality</hi> for Grace; but 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that ſince thoſe Rationiſts (ſo called) have done ſo, the world hath more and more abounded with all kinde of irrational <hi>Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> which ſeems as a teſtimony from Heaven againſt that lying Doctrine.

Now Civility or Morality is Nature (of the beſt Edition) rarely refined and dreſſed up, yea decked with her choiceſt and chiefeſt Ornaments: This is verily good (and 'twere well if there were more of it in the world) yet it is not good enough to make you

approved of God in Chriſt, you may (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this) be as that houſe (which was <hi>poſſeſſed, diſpoſſed,</hi> and <hi>repoſſeſſed,) Matth.</hi> 12. 43, 44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [an <hi>houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed;]</hi> accordingly may your Heart be, 1. <hi>Swept</hi> well of foul Moral Vices. 2. <hi>Garniſhed</hi> handſomely with fair Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. The fifth falſe Ground whereby your Heart may deceive you is, a mere <hi>external Profeſſion,</hi> without the <hi>power and practice of Piety:</hi> As (1.) you may think well of your Spiritual ſtate, becauſe you are <hi>born in the Church.</hi> Alas, you may be born <hi>in</hi> the Church, and yet not be <hi>of</hi> the Church. Thus profane <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were (both of them) born in the Church, yet were they not of the Church: And ſo were thoſe murmuring <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> born in the Church in the Wilderneſs (ſo called, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 38.) yet God was highly diſpleaſed with them, ſo as to <hi>deſtroy</hi> them there, for <hi>being Murmurers,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 5. 10.

The barren Fig-tree is nearer curſing than the wild Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the one being in the Garden, where and whence <hi>better;</hi> the other in the Wilderneſs, where and whence <hi>no better</hi> is expected.

               <p n="7">7. The ſixth falſe Ground of this Self-deceiving, as to your Spiritual ſtate, may be your reſting in a <hi>Notional</hi> Knowledge, without any <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Experimental</hi> Knowledge: There is a <hi>form of knowledge,</hi> Rom. 2. 20. as well as a <hi>form of Godlineſs, without the power of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. Knowledg is (indeed) <hi>the key of the kingdome,</hi> Luke 11. 52. But you may have the wrong key (that will not open the door into the Kingdome) if you have not <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying</hi> knowledge: Your <hi>tree of knowledge</hi> (if the tree of Life be not with it) will want <hi>the ſap of Grace,</hi> and then 'twill bring forth leaves only. You may have <hi>light</hi>

without <hi>heat;</hi> the Glow-worm and rotten wood do ſeem to have much light in them, but either of them (being cold by Nature) can have little heat. 'Tis a certain great Truth, that one ſingle <hi>Dram</hi> of Saving Grace is worth a whole <hi>Pound</hi> of Notional Knowledge: Moreover, a Man is ſaid to know no more than he doth practiſe; 'tis ſaid of Chriſt <hi>[That he knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21.] becauſe he did not practiſe ſin: No doubt but Chriſt had an <hi>intellectual</hi> knowledge of ſin (for he had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of good and evil) otherwiſe he could not have reproved it; yet had he no <hi>practical</hi> knowledge of it, and therefore is he ſaid not to know it. As Chriſt knew no more of evil than he did practiſe (which was none at all;) ſo you know no more of good than you do practiſe: Knowledge and Profeſſion without Power and Practice will make you (indeed) as <hi>Rachel, beautiful,</hi> but <hi>barren;</hi> and (as <hi>Ephraim) a Cake not turned,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 8. ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the one ſide only, but plain dough only on the other ſide: theſe are caſt-away Cakes (that are raw on the one ſide, and burnt or ſcorched on the other,) as unpleaſant to the palate (in both the ſides) amongſt men; accordingly dough-baked Duties will not down with God. <hi>Irreligious Honeſty</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Religion</hi> are both (alike) check-aſide Groats, and Cakes not turned to the Lord;

Now having diſcovered the falſe Grounds of Self-deceit, which are the true Cauſes of your Spiritual Diſtemper; in order to the compleating of your Cure, and to an effectual Application of the right Remedy, 'twill be expedient to inform you, how you may diſtinguiſh betwixt falſe grounds and true, that you may be undeceived. And that this may be done the more diſtinctly, and particularly; the ſecond Queſtion (to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) ſhall be, <hi>How you may put a difference 'twixt Nature and Grace,</hi> that you miſtake not the former for the latter? To this I anſwer, You may have a good Nature, yea a Nature better than others; yet this is but a beautiful Abomination, and a ſmoother way to Hell and Damnation: to miſtake Nature for Grace, ſpeaketh out as much blindneſs, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much groſs and ſublime Ignorance, as to miſtake the <hi>burnt</hi> Temple for the <hi>built</hi> one. <hi>Ezra</hi> comes to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> findes the Temple <hi>burnt,</hi> but leaves it <hi>built:</hi> Could any Jew be ſo ſottiſh as to put no difference 'twixt the

               </p>
               <p>(1.) In reſpect of the <hi>Perſon. Reſtraining</hi> Grace is given to the good and bad promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuouſly; but <hi>Renewing</hi> Grace is given to the good only: Thus the former was conferr'd upon the Heathen King <hi>Abimelech,</hi> upon wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Saul,</hi> and the like, as before; and the reaſon is, becauſe the End of it is for the good of others, as is aforeſaid. 'Tis poſſible that the receiver of <hi>reſtraining</hi> Grace may receive no benefit at all to himſelf by it, eſpecially no benefit that <hi>accompanies Salvation,</hi> Hebr. 6. 9. (2.) In reſpect of <hi>Time.

(3.) In reſpect of the <hi>Subject. Reſtraining</hi> Grace may binde the hand, when not the tongue or the heart; it may leave both them at liberty. Thus <hi>Saul</hi>'s hands were ſometimes tyed up by <hi>David</hi>'s Innocency and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Interceſſion, while his tongue and heart were at liberty to do <hi>David</hi> a miſchief. (4.) In reſpect of the <hi>Object. Reſtraining</hi> Grace may lay fetters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man in his way to this or that notorious ſin, and yet the man may have elbow-room

enough in his way to other ſins.

(1.) Before Converſion, <hi>Your heart will then love a lazy Religion,</hi> (although ſome Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Duty be upon you) and ſuch as <hi>coſts you nothing,</hi> or very little; whereas holy <hi>David would not offer</hi> to the Lord his God, that which <hi>did not coſt him</hi> ſomething, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. He would <hi>honour God with his ſubſtance,</hi> Prov. 3. 9. and lay out ſome coſt for him, as the good Woman did in her <hi>Spikenard of great price,</hi> John 12. 3.

               <p n="3">3.

Reverend Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith excellently, that there is no outward Calling ſo very full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Employments, but that in the ſpace of twenty four hours, ſome time might be ſpared and redeemed for Religious Duties. 'Tis true, God doth not expect ſo much Duty from you (that live in an outward Calling) as he doth from thoſe whoſe Calling is the Miniſtry (who ſhould dedicate their whole times and their whole talents unto God) yet know, that God gives to none <hi>a licenſe to be lazy;</hi> and if you neglect your Duty to God, you will be in danger of Judgments from God, <hi>[Let us go and ſacrifice to our God, leſt he fall upon us with his plagues]</hi> Exod. 5. 3. As <hi>omiſſion of Diet</hi> breeds Diſeaſes in the Body, and makes work for Death, or for the bodily (Phyſician: So <hi>omiſſion of Duty</hi> breeds Diſtempers in the Soul, and I makes work for Hell, or for the Soul-Phyſicians: Alas, it was Omiſſion of Duty (a Sin of Omiſſion) that <hi>baniſhed</hi> Moab <hi>from the Church, to the tenth Geveration,</hi> Deut. 23. 3, 4, 5. and that <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. The ſecond Deceit is, When you are brought from <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>Duty,</hi> and from the <hi>Omiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of it; then may your heart deceive you in overvaluing Duty, <hi>in living upon it,</hi> and <hi>reſting in it:</hi> We are not <hi>ignorant of Satans devices,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 11. that envious one. If he cannot keep you <hi>too much</hi> on the left hand, he will throw you <hi>too far</hi> on the right, and make you ſet up duty in Chriſts ſtead; and cauſe you to give it that honour, which is due to Chriſt: Juſt as <hi>Darius</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did obeiſance to <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> miſtaking him for <hi>Alexander</hi> (himſelf) ſaluting the Favourite for the Prince. When the Devil (in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with your own heart) can no longer prevail to make you <hi>undervalue</hi> Duty (in neglecting of it) then (alas) he will ſtrongly tempt you to <hi>overvalue</hi> Duty, and to ſet it up as a Saviour to you; well knowing how offenſive it is to Chriſt to juſtle in any Competitors or Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals with him in the matter of Salvation, who will be <hi>one and all,</hi> or he will be <hi>none at all;</hi> As Chriſt trode the Wine-preſs alone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 3. to bring you into his Wine-cellar, <hi>Gant.</hi> 2. 4. So <hi>beſides him, there is no Saviour,</hi> Iſai. 43. 11.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48861:114"/>
And though Chriſt muſt <hi>ſit upon the Throne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, yet then will he have <hi>his Train</hi> (to wit, Holy Duties) <hi>to fill the Temple,</hi> Iſai. 6. 1. So that you muſt diſtinguiſh them, and know the one from the other, as your Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham knew his Lord</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>from</hi> the two <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angels,</hi> Gen. 18. 2, 3. You muſt <hi>give to duty the things that are duty's, and to Chriſt the things that are Chriſts:</hi> The three Wiſe-men, when they <hi>ſaw the Star</hi> (that was their guide to Chriſt) <hi>did not fall down to worſhip it,</hi> but Chriſt himſelf to whom it led them. They did not offer their <hi>Gold, Myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> to the Star, but to Chriſt, who is called <hi>The bright and Morning Star,</hi> Revel. 22. 16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As the Dyal cannot tell you what is the hour of the day, unleſs the Sun do ſhine upon it; ſo your beſt Duties cannot ſhow you any hour or time of Joy, any further than while <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> (the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.) doth ſhine upon them. Alas, what doth <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Mantle ſignifie to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> unleſs he have alſo <hi>the Lord God of that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> 2 Kin. 2. 14. Therefore take heed you reſt not in bare Duty; you muſt not live upon <hi>duty,</hi> but upon <hi>Chriſt in duty;</hi> for your <hi>life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. You muſt let go your Duties in point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and yet hold them (as your life) in point of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> for Duty ſhould not <hi>dye</hi> while you <hi>live;</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:48861:114"/>
you muſt do them, but you may not glory in them, <hi>[Let him that gloryeth, glory in the Lord,]</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 31. Thus bleſſed <hi>Paul ſuffered the loſs of all his duties, [Non quoad ſubſtantiam, ſea quoad qualitatem &amp; officium juſtificandi,]</hi> Phil. 3. 7, 8. He did not depend upon his Duties for his Juſtification (as before he had done in his <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſtate,) nor laid he now the ſtreſs of his Salvation upon them, but he <hi>caſt the great burden</hi> of both <hi>upon the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 55. 22. Alas, as your <hi>goodneſs</hi> (in Duty) <hi>extends not to God,</hi> Pſal. 16. 2. and you cannot be <hi>profitale to him,</hi> Job 22. 2, 3. God <hi>receives nothing at your hand,</hi> (by all) Job 35. 7. So when you have done all you can, you are ſtill but <hi>an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant,</hi> Luke 17. 10. Your beſt Duties are but <hi>filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. though they be pure in the fountain, as flowing from the Holy Spirit, yet are they muddy in the ſtream, as they run through the dirty channel of your corrupted heart; and therefore thoſe Popiſh Doctrines (of Merit <hi>de Congruo,</hi> and <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno,</hi> and of <hi>Supererogation)</hi> are no better than lying Doctrines.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The third Deceit of the Heart is, After you have been an <hi>overvaluer</hi> of Duty ſome time, Satan (and your own heart) <hi>may beguile you,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 11. to become an <hi>undervaluer</hi> of Duty again in the days of your Knowledge, as before you had been in the days of your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48861:115"/>
Thus the Adverſary of your Soul will toſs you into extremes, backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yea and backward again, making you to ſleight and contemn Duties again, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another bottom now; to wit, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of making Chriſt your All: As if Chriſt had given you now <hi>a licenſe to be lazy:</hi> But ſurely you <hi>never ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 20. As you have <hi>received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo ſhould you walk in him,</hi> Col. 2. 6. and being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi> (by him) therefore <hi>muſt you ſerve him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all your days,</hi> Luk. 1. 74, 75. And ſeeing you are <hi>bought with the price</hi> (of his blood) therefore muſt you <hi>Glorifie him with your body and ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. for you are not <hi>yet come to your reſt,</hi> Deut. 12. 9. and until you be come to your eternal Reſt (or Sabbath) you muſt not <hi>ceaſe from your ſpiritual work,</hi> labour or duty, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 10. So that Duties muſt not dye, while you live; and as long as you are on this ſide <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo long muſt you be doing Duty on <hi>Earth;</hi> This is the place of our performing <hi>work,</hi> and that of our receiving <hi>wages:</hi> You may not transfer all your <hi>work</hi> from your ſelf upon Chriſt, as if nothing were due from you, and to be done by you. 'Twas a good Saying of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s <hi>[Acti agimus, &amp; ſervati ſumus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ut ſerviamus.]</hi> We are acted by the Spirit of Chriſt, that we (our ſelves) may act for Chriſt; and we are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48861:115"/>
ſaved by our Saviour, that we may ſerve our Saviour. Though God made us without our ſelves, he will not (ſaith that Father) ſave us without our ſelves: There is a triple-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (to wit, of Reverence, of Obedience, and of Thankfulneſs) which is your poor Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn you muſt carefully pay to the Lord and Landlord of all your Mercies: They that would have healing, there is ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be done by them; they muſt ſtep into <hi>the opened Fountain,</hi> Zech. 13. 1. as the diſeaſed did into <hi>the Pool of Betheſda,</hi> Joh. 5, 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you compare <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 6. with 7. 14. together, theſe two Scriptures will ſhew you, that not only Chriſt doth <hi>waſh you,</hi> but that you muſt alſo <hi>waſh your ſelf</hi> in the <hi>blood of the Lamb;</hi> and hence is it, that the Lord calls upon you, to this <hi>waſhing work,</hi> Iſai. 1. 15. God will give you Grace, juſt as <hi>Boaz</hi> gave <hi>Ruth</hi> corn, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 15. He could have given her an Ephah of Barley (ready winnowed to her hand) without more ado; but mark, ſhe <hi>muſt gather it up</hi> into gleanings, and <hi>beat it out</hi> of the ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though the corn was <hi>Boaz</hi>'s <hi>gift,</hi> yet all this was <hi>Ruths duty,</hi> which was all the price ſhe ſhould pay for it. Thus the very Heathen could ſay, <hi>[Dii laboribus omnia vendunt,]</hi> God ſells all <hi>his bleſſings</hi> for <hi>mans labour;</hi> 'tis all one charge to him, yet thus he gives both Grace and Knowledge; and God's
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48861:116"/>
promiſe <hi>of Mercy</hi> is no exemption to man <hi>from Duty.</hi> He promis'd deliverance from the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> Captivity, yet <hi>for that will he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after,</hi> Ezek. 36. 12. 37. <hi>[Ora, labora, &amp; admotâ manu invocanda eſt Minerva,]</hi> were good Sayings of wiſe Heathens. <hi>Duty is the way to Mercy:</hi> Oh then take heed of being <hi>weary of duty,</hi> (which is near of kin to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde. A Child of God may be weary <hi>in it,</hi> but never <hi>of it,</hi> for he is <hi>a ſerving Son,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. If once you become too <hi>good for duty,</hi> you'l aſſuredly prove <hi>too weak for holineſs:</hi> A little Child gathers ſtrength by its due and daily ſucking the breaſt, but if it be Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, or hindred from ſucking by any other impediment, 'twill ſenſibly (as well as inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) ſoon pine away. Our Spiritual life is as our Natural life, both which Lives are <hi>within us,</hi> yet neither of them do ariſe and are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed from our ſelves, but from ſomething that is <hi>without us.</hi> Hence is it, that you ſtand in as much need of <hi>daily bread</hi> for your <hi>Soul,</hi> as you do for your <hi>Body:</hi> And this Bread of Life comes diſh'd up to you in divine Duties.

               <p n="8">8. The fourth Deceit of the Heart herein is, <hi>'Twill wander from God in duty,</hi> it cannot <hi>watch with Chriſt one hour,</hi> Matth. 26. 40. nor <hi>attend the Lord without diſtraction,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.35.

ſervice, but ſervile drudgery; but God (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the language of their hearts) detects their Hypocriſie, telling them, he preſſeth upon no man, neither liketh he that ſervice that is preſſed out of people, as Verjuice is preſſed out of Crabs: All his Saints, Subjects and Soldiers are Volunteers, <hi>a willing people,</hi> that bring their Free-will-offering to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3.

               <p n="10">10. The ſixth Deceit is, <hi>You may look more at the Acceptation of the Action performed, than at the perſon performing:</hi> 'Tis true, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, (the firſt Covenant) God firſt accepted of the Action, and then of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48861:118"/>

               <p n="11">11.

Alas, a <hi>Cain</hi> may offer ſacrifice as well as an <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and a <hi>Doeg</hi> may ſtep as far into the Sanctuary as a <hi>David,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 7. yea, a proud Phariſee may ſtep far fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Temple than a penitent Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 10, 11. 13. yet with differing ſpirits and principles: All your Deeds and Duties ſhould be made manifeſt <hi>that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. 3. 21. that is, from a good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as well as from a good End: <hi>Jehu</hi> did excellent things for God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 16. yet that which ſpoiled all was, that all his high and noble exploits did ſpring from a low and ignoble ſpirit and principle, in not purſuing Gods praiſe ſo much, as his own promotion.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48861:120"/>
The (2.) Rule is, <hi>Go forth in the ſtrength of the Lord into every Duty,</hi> Pſal. 71. 16 Take heed of fetching Materials of Duty from your ſelf, making Duty a matter of Wit, of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of natural Abilities. Alas, this is but <hi>a lifting up your own tool upon Gods Altar</hi> (which will not <hi>poliſh,</hi> but <hi>pollute</hi> it,) <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. 25. Duties that are made up of parts, words and wit (as <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Parphar,</hi> rivers of <hi>Damaſcus)</hi> may indeed ſcour, but 'tis Duty done in Gods ſtrength (as Iſrael's <hi>Jordan)</hi> can cure the Leproſie, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5.12. 14.

               <p n="14">14. The third Rule is, <hi>Never ſit down ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in Duty, without the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 19. who muſt <hi>help your infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. <hi>Gre.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

Cant. 4. 16. and praying, <hi>Lord, quicken me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 37. As endeavours [withou God] cannot, ſo God [without endeavours] will not quicken that ſpiritual principle; the flint muſt be ſtruck upon the ſteel, or there is no fetching of fire out of it: You ſhould ſtir up your ſelf for, and intereſt Chriſt in all your Duties, that <hi>the ſword of the Lord and of</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon may go (hand in hand) together, <hi>Jud.</hi> 7. 18. 20. The (4.) Rule is, <hi>Do Duties for right Ends,</hi> as well as from <hi>a right Principle,</hi> by <hi>a right Strength,</hi> and with <hi>a right Supply.</hi> Right ends of Duty are, 1. That God may be honoured by it. 2. That your thankfulneſs to the God of your Mercy may be expreſſed. 3. That thoſe Duties may be profitable to others, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. And laſtly, That your Soul may meet with Chriſt in them. You ſhould

cry in every Duty, have over (Lord) for Heaven, getting a full tide of Affections; and cry with <hi>David, Oh that I had wings,</hi> Pſal. 55. 6. and winde in my wings. <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14. even the wings of a dove, wherewithal you may flye to the Ark of Mercy, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s dove did.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The fifth Rule is, <hi>See that your heart reſt not ſhort of Chriſt in any Duty.</hi> Let go your hold of no Duty, until you finde ſomething of Chriſt in it; and until you get not only an <hi>handful,</hi> but an <hi>armful</hi> (with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2.28.) yea an <hi>heartful</hi> of the bleſſed and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Babe of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> therein.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, a man may ſave others, and not ſave himſelf, but <hi>be a caſt away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 29. at laſt: Hence the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> that he be careful <hi>to ſave himſelf, as well as others,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. Thoſe Hypocrites (Preachers) that in Chriſt's Name had <hi>caſt out Devils,</hi> were (as unknown to Chriſt) at length <hi>caſt out to Devils,</hi> Matth. 7. 22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond Anſwer is more particular, for diſtinguiſhing Gifts from Graces; They differ (1.) <hi>In their original,</hi> though both come from one and the ſame Holy Spirit, yet 'tis in a different reſpect; for Gifts do flow from the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48861:124"/>
Spirit, as he is <hi>an aſſiſting Spirit</hi> only, and not <hi>an indwelling Spirit</hi> alſo. But Grace always flows from the Spirit, as both Aſſiſting and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling too: 'tis thus illuſtrated; As a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter may both build an Houſe, and beget a Childe, yet one and the ſame individual man is the original of both theſe, but with this difference; the houſe (that he builds) partakes of his Art only, and the Child (he begets) doth partake of his very Nature: So Gifts, though they do come from the ſame Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (that works ſaving Grace) yet are they but <hi>[Opera ad extra]</hi> external Operations, and not the proper and genuine fruits of an Indwelling, as well as of an Aſſiſting Spirit. A Pilot is ſaid to be (in Philoſophy) the <hi>[forma aſſiſtens]</hi> to guide the Ship in its Navigation; but 'tis the Soul that is the <hi>[forma informans]</hi> to guide the Body in all its Motions and Operations. Oh ſee that the Spirit be your <hi>[Soul]</hi> in Grace, as well as your <hi>[Pilot]</hi> in Gifts. (2.) <hi>In their Object;</hi> Gifts are more for <hi>Honour,</hi> than for <hi>Holineſs;</hi> but Grace is more for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> than for <hi>Honour:</hi> 'Twas <hi>Saul</hi>'s cry, (who had got <hi>the Gift of Prophecy, when he was among the Prophets,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 10.) <hi>Yet honour me now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 30.

               <p n="5">5. The ſecond Deceit, (which is the ſecond enquiry) is your <hi>taking and miſ-taking [ſeeming]</hi> Grace for <hi>[ſaving]</hi> grace, or falſe for true grace: that you may be undeceived herein, learn to diſtinguiſh them by theſe following Characters. (1.) Falſe grace in an unſound and hypocritical heart, hath evermore its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and exerciſe from <hi>forreign and extrinſick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> as carnal reſpects, by and baſe ends, the applauſe of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juſt like Puppits in a daunce, that have no principle of life in them, but are acted by an external force: but true ſaving grace hath not onely an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but alſo a propenſity to comply with the Law of God; there is a <hi>law in the mind, Rom.</hi> 7. 23. which is <hi>writ in the heart, Hebr.</hi> 8. 10. this is call'd a Law, becauſe it carries an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with it, and ſways down the Soul into a conformity to the will of God; this makes the ſound heart to <hi>love Gods precepts</hi> becauſe <hi>they are pure, Pſal.</hi> 119. 140. and inclines it as a ſtrong byaſs, (ſtronger then all the external motives) <hi>to love the Goſpel for the Goſpels ſake.</hi> Whereas the Hypocrite doth onely <hi>[uti Deo, ut fruat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſaith. Thus <hi>Jehu obey'd Gods will,</hi> but it was that he might attain to a Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The (2.) Character is, ſuch as deceive themſelves with falſe and ſeeming grace, <hi>never look for, nor labour after</hi> true and ſaving grace; ſuch never ſearch nor ſuſpect themſelves; <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> came lagging in at laſt, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> Such never put themſelves under a ſerious and ſtrict ſcrutiny, ſaying, Am I yet got beyond the attainments of an Hypocrite? <hi>Holy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is a bleſſed frame of ſpirit;</hi> and a ſolemn ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of being deceived, is a comfortable ſign of a ſound ſincerity: He that never doubted, never truely believed; and ſuch as go on in an uninterrupted eſtate, (bleſſing themſelves all along with bare ſhows of grace) have a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſymptome of deſtruction upon them: Until <hi>Egypts</hi> dough was ſpent, God gave no Mauna; and ſo long as the Bridegrooms wine laſted, Chriſt turned no water into wine. The (3.) Character is, Falſe <hi>grace is never comforted with Gods preſence;</hi> ſuch hearts dare never ſet themſelves ſolemnly in the ſight of divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, (as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 6. and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139. 23, 24. and <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 21. 17. ſincere Souls all:) for they know, though they may deceive men, they <hi>cannot deceive God,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. whereas true Grace dare appeal to <hi>Omniſciency</hi> about the general frame of the heart. Though it undoubtedly trembles in that Appeal, for its

frequent frailties, as <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. yet is it confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent its Integrity will carry weight: for though it may depart from God out of <hi>weakneſs,</hi> yet never out of <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 18.21. and though acts (yet <hi>not ways) of wickedneſs</hi> be found in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.24.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The fourth Character is, <hi>falſe grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attended with humility;</hi> if the more you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the prouder you grow, you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect your ſelf: but with true grace, <hi>the more Holy</hi> you are, the <hi>more humble</hi> you will be: as the <hi>Centurion, Matth.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 7. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional knowledge puffeth up (as above) but the divine light of ſaving knowledge <hi>ſhining into a dark heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. diſcovers your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, (that there is more you know not, than that you know) this humbles: the people thought the <hi>Centurion</hi> worthy; yea, and Chriſt (himſelf) thought the man <hi>worthy;</hi> yet the man doth think himſelf <hi>unworthy.</hi> The more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge you have, the more ſenſe of your own ignorance you will have alſo; and the <hi>more faith,</hi> the <hi>more ſenſe</hi> of your unbelief, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. 'Tis a bleſſed frame; to be kept hungry and humble, under an Enjoyment of grace, crying, Lord I ſtill want this grace and that grace. The (fifth and laſt) Character is, <hi>falſe grace never grows, unleſs it be worſe and worſe:</hi> guilded things looſe their luſtre and glory by wearing, and

pretences to grace do rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wither than thrive or proſper. God complaineth that they <hi>went backward</hi> rather then forward, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7. 24. Falſe grace, like bad ſalt, looſeth gradually its own Acrimony and ſmartneſs, until it be caſt to the dunghill; whereas true grace, as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, grows to a tree; from a morning glimpſe, <hi>to a perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18. from ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>flax,</hi> to a burning <hi>flame, Matth.</hi> 12. 20. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> grows from timerouſneſs to boldneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 39. when <hi>Judas</hi> (with all his goodly ſhews of grace) did dwindle into nothing: if there be never ſo little meal in the barrel, never ſo little Oil in the Cruiſe, yet it being fed with a ſupply from heaven, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies into abundance: if you grow from fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency to formality, from ſtrictneſs to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if you can looſe the ſweetneſs of your ſpirit without remorſe, 'tis a ſhrewd ſign; but if you have received grace in the truth of it, then you grow, 1. <hi>[formâ]</hi> in lovelineſs to Chriſt. 2. <hi>[Suavitate]</hi> bringing ſweeter <hi>Cane</hi> to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 24. 3. <hi>[Robore]</hi> better root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the houſe of <hi>David</hi> growing ſtronger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. And fourthly, <hi>[vigore]</hi> every grace that is feeble will be nouriſh'd, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 13. you then grow both in kind and degree: growing youth oft meaſure themſelves, they have better appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites than older people.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The third deceit, (which is the third enquiry) is your taking and miſtaking common grace for ſpecial:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48861:128"/>
that you may be undeceived, know, that there is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace,</hi> which is, (1.) <hi>more than civility,</hi> it being of a more evangelical and heavenly nature than civility is. (2.) <hi>'Tis more than restraining grace,</hi> which is converſant onely about ſins and duties, out of a ſervile awe and fear of God; but this ſeemeth to carry out the Soul with ſome raiſed affections and love to Chriſt. (3.) <hi>'Tis more than meer outward gifts;</hi> which raiſe up a man above ordinary, onely for an uſefulneſs to others; but this ſeems to renew the man, and make him another man than he was before. (4.) <hi>'Tis more than ſeeming grace or formality,</hi> which hath onely <hi>[veriſimilia] ſeeming true,</hi> but not <hi>[vera] really true,</hi> a meer ſhew and ſhadow of godlineſs; but This is a real work upon the Soul, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5. declareth, being not onely an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, and a partaking of gifts, but alſo ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual taſt of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, and of the powers of the world to come: yet obſerve, all this amounted not to ſpecial grace in three things: 1. <hi>Their light was not humbling,</hi> there is mention of their <hi>enlightening,</hi> but not a word of their <hi>humbling:</hi> the more of ſaving light is let into the Soul, the more ſelf-abaſement doth that light beget there; the <hi>more precious</hi> that Chriſt is in our eyes, the <hi>more vile</hi> we are in our own eyes; they cloſed with Chriſt in a way of pride and preſumption onely: 2. <hi>Their gifts were not renewing and ſanctifying;</hi> they made them uſeful to the Church, but did not change their hearrs: they were tinkling cymbals, in their <hi>lovely</hi> expreſſions, but not veſſels of gold in any divine and lively impreſſions: their <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> did not walk hand in hand together. 3. <hi>Their taſt was neither refreſhing nor raviſhing,</hi> it did not draw the Soul after a farther and fuller enlargement and enjoyment of Chriſt; they had but ſleight and looſe deſires after Chriſt and Salvation: bare glances of heavenly glory, may ſtir up an overly wiſh, even in a very Sorcerer, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſay, <hi>[Oh let me dye the death of the righteous] Numb.</hi> 23. 10. but this falls far ſhort of thoſe ſerious
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48861:128"/>
longings of Soul after Chriſt, and after grace and ſtrength, <hi>to ſerve him with our ſpirits in the Goſpel of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 1. 9. 'Twas, alas, but a taſt they had, as a Cook may taſt of his Maſters ſawce, but he lets none go down; their taſt neither <hi>refreſhed</hi> nor <hi>raviſhed</hi> them, as a right taſt of Chriſt doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 8. a little makes us long for more, it makes us long for larger Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt in his <hi>graces,</hi> as well as in his <hi>comforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Common Grace is diſtinguiſhable from ſpecial Grace; (1.) As <hi>it comes from a common Original,</hi> as from Illumination, Conviction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Common things to the bad as well as the good, if ſitting alike under the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Sanctuary, where the Hammer of the Word is always battering: Though ſome there be which (as the Anvile) grow harder by beating; yet others there be, that cannot bear off the blow; but (as <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6. 20.) are wrought on and brought up <hi>to do many things:</hi> This is found in Servants as well as in Sons: You muſt labour for that Grace which never was, nor ever can be given to a Reprobate. The Original Cauſe of Grace is threefold; 1. <hi>Primary.</hi> 2. <hi>Meritorious.</hi> 3. <hi>Immediate.</hi> As to the <hi>Primary</hi> Cauſe; firſt, <hi>Special Grace flows from Election,</hi> from the Electing Love of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. But common Grace comes not from God, as he gives out <hi>Elective Love to ſome,</hi> but as he is the <hi>Authour of common Gifts to many.</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe. Special Grace is from Chriſt, as a <hi>Redeemer</hi> of thoſe that receive it; Common Grace is from Chriſt as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> to them that receive it; and though as <hi>(a)</hi> Redeemer, yet not as <hi>(their)</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>3ly.</hi> The <hi>Immediate</hi> and next efficient Cauſe of ſpecial Grace is, the <hi>indwelling</hi> Spirit, (called <hi>the Seed of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. and <hi>The Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>A living principle from the life of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18.) But the next efficient Cauſe of common Grace is, the Spirit only <hi>aſſiſting</hi> [but not <hi>indwelling,]</hi> caſting ſome ſupernatural light upon the Soul of man. The ſecond difference 'twixt Common and Special Grace is, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace is ſeated in a common ſpirit;</hi> ſo called, becauſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48861:129"/>
it cannot <hi>do more than others,</hi> Mat. 5. 47. Such a Spirit cannot do any ſingular things for God, and ſuch as are above a common and ordinary Attainment: Hence it is, that when Special Grace loſeth its luſtre, and an overly Indifferency ſeiſeth upon the Soul, 'tis hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from common Grace; ſave only, <hi>That ſpecial Grace is ſenſible of it, and bewails it;</hi> but common Grace is too too-well contented with it. But <hi>Caleb</hi> was <hi>of another</hi> (and better) <hi>Spirit,</hi> Numb. 14. 24. The third Difference, Common Grace <hi>hath only common effects,</hi> their profeſſion of Godlineſs and performance of Duties are but common things, flowing rather from a work <hi>on</hi> them, than <hi>in</hi> them; 'tis rather a <hi>forced</hi> than a <hi>natural</hi> work from a new Nature; 'tis rather a <hi>flaſh,</hi> than a <hi>fire</hi> of divine affection; a <hi>tranſient</hi> motion, but no <hi>abiding</hi> principle. The truths of the Word (which they ſit under) paſſes through them, as water through a Conduit-pipe, leaves only a dew, but ſinks not in, as rain-water into the earth, to make it fruitful: a bare taſte of any diſh (though never ſo good) nouriſhes not into ſtrength and ſtature: Therefore hath it (4.) Common defects; as 1. <hi>It mindes not the intrinſecal wickedneſs</hi> of the heart. Nor 2. <hi>The ſpiritual exactneſs of the Law.</hi> 3. Common Grace mindes <hi>moſtly Negative Precepts.</hi> 4. If poſitive, not in <hi>their full extent</hi> as to occaſions and circumſtances. 5. <hi>'Tis a ſtranger to the myſtery of the new birth.</hi> 6. <hi>'Tis without fear of being deceived,</hi> being more exerciſed in Self-flattery, than in Self-reflection; uſing rather the falſe glaſſes of Satan, than the Spectacles of the Spirit. 7. <hi>'Tis always barren;</hi> If Grace be not right in reſpect of its <hi>root,</hi> it muſt always be defective in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>fruit,</hi> ſo comes to nothing at laſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6, 7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. This is the Grace that may finally be fallen from; Time and Temptation wears off the gilt, and turns <hi>ſeeming Sanctity</hi> into <hi>real Senſuality:</hi> many young Saints (Seraphick in their Knowledge, and ſeeming to have their eyes fixed to the Stars) prove but old Devils, and fall at laſt into the pit of Senſuality. Oh keep your hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
